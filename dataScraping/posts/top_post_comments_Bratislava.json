I usually have last year inflation in contracts ... and that is usually also a starting point for negotiation (even if contract says it is automatic as a tenant you always have an option to not accept it and leave for another property; for landlord this might be undesired if he is happy with you, also it is a complication for him/her - looking for somebody new takes time, perhaps causes cost for involvement of the real estate agency .... so motivation is there to find a mutually convenient setup)",
