The flight on the 1st of January is around 10:00 in the morning and I will be staying around La Sa√Ødia.  \n  \nWhat is my best option to be sure I get to the airport on time: Taxi, Uber, FreeNow, Cabify, bus, metro?  \nI am afraid that I will miss my flight since it's early in the morning on the 1st of  January and it's a National day.  \n\n\nThank you in advance for any advice.",
