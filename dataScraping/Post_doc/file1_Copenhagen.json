I speak English perfectly, as well as a couple of other languages, however no Danish.\n\nI am looking into applying for a Master's degree in Copenhagen (most likely CBS). Even though I finished the Bachelor's in Slovenia (EU), I am from Macedonia (Balkan), and therefore not an EU citizen. So, considering the high standard of life, I am looking to enroll into a part - time program, where I would be working a minimum of 25h/week.\n\n1. Is part - time work considered a student job? What salary should I expect/aim for?\n2. How difficult is it to find work in the field of studies? Does it matter to the employer that I am not from the EU?\n\nI do have previous working experiences, 2 internships, one of 2 months and one of 6 months, both within my field of studies.\n\n3. Which channel would you recommend for finding a job? - Linkedin/JobTeaser and such; sending emails to recruiters; going in person with a CV in my hand; or going to job fairs??? Or something else?\n\n4. What is the general opinion on the school? Is it worth it to go there? (CBS)\n\nI am asking this because I have an EU passport in the process of making, but if the school doesn't recognize that, then I would be required to pay the tuition fee, hence, the part - time studies.\n\n5. If there is any, what opinion do Danes hold for Balkan people? Be honest, I've travelled a lot, I am used to it.\n\n6. Finally, I've visited all Nordic countries, and I do have an A2 in Norwegian, so just being curious, is it transferable into Danish?\n\nThank you in advance to anyone that replies, I value the opinion and information of the public more than school websites. I appreciate any additional info, and I just want to say - Copenhagen in the summer is the best place on Earth!!!\n\nTak for hjælpen!",

A lot of museums even outside of Copenhagen can be visited via public transport pretty decently (Louisiana is ok, Helsingør is great, Roskilde is easy, Hillerød is great, Arken is passable).\n\nAnyway, public transportation isn't that difficult. You can get the [City Pass large](https://www.publictransport.dk/tickets/citypass) which covers the entirety of the north and don't think about it or use the DSB app to pay per ride (and unlike the German system of zones you don't need a degree in law to understand how many zones you need because the app will do all the pointless bookkeeping for you and it works in the entire mainland Denmark). Also, trains usually run relatively late and you're less likely to get stuck at night (looking at you, Munich!).\n\nHonestly, I would just take public transport because I wouldn't wanna deal with potential car sharing issues and differences between traffic customs in Germany vs Denmark, but admittedly that with 4 people that might be overall more expensive because public transport does not offer any group tickets.",

If you're a student and working part time most people would consider that a student job.\n\n>What salary should I expect/aim for?\n\nProbably around 120-130 kr/hour for non-skilled work (restaurants, bars etc) or 160-170 for office jobs relevant to your degree. It likely won't be enough to cover tuition and living costs.\n\n>How difficult is it to find work in the field of studies? Does it matter to the employer that I am not from the EU?\n\nPretty easy for a typical Danish CBS student but in my experience Eastern European students are more likely to end up doing service jobs or Wolt deliveries. As long as you're allowed to work I doubt your EU status will matter.\n\n>Which channel would you recommend for finding a job? - Linkedin/JobTeaser and such; sending emails to recruiters; going in person with a CV in my hand; or going to job fairs??? Or something else?\n\nLinkedIn, CBS job fairs, CBS online job board, JobIndex etc for professional jobs. I don't really know about service work – probably Instagram and talking to people.\n\n>What is the general opinion on the school? Is it worth it to go there? (CBS)\n\nIt's pretty well regarded but some degrees seem a bit easy, especially when people can work almost full-time and complete their degrees at the same time.\n\n>If there is any, what opinion do Danes hold for Balkan people? Be honest, I've travelled a lot, I am used to it.\n\nI don't think people have strong opinions about Balkan people. We took a lot of refugees in the 90s and they seem to have turned out fine.\n\nMost Eastern European students I've met in Copenhagen have been studying at non-university programs like \"business academies\", working service jobs and smoking lots of weed. So that's my stereotype :)\n\n>Finally, I've visited all Nordic countries, and I do have an A2 in Norwegian, so just being curious, is it transferable into Danish?\n\nYeah it's pretty much the same.

Uhm, my [Google Maps looks like this](https://imgur.com/a/S4fDYMd), so basically just about anything in Indre By, Vesterbro or Nørrebro is worth checking out. Incidentally that's exactly what I would recommend. The city is quite walkable and overall also quite pretty so walking around at random and exploring is actually a great way to experience Copenhagen.\n\nIt depends what you're interested in.
