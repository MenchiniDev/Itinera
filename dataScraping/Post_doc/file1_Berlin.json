That should be something that the landlord has to deal with, but I wonder if they can kick you out to deal with the issue. With the current flat market, it seems impossible to find a flat if the landlord decides that you can't live in your flat due to construction work.",

Because as of now (almost 1.5 years later), still no deposit returned...For the avoidance of doubt, I do not seek legal advice, but rather a friendly heads up/sharing your experiences in similar situations",
