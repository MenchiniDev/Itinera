I would rather know what anyone can gain and have crowdfunded limits applied to political parties.\n\nLet's humour your little reply though...\n\nThe Tories have had their share of donations from Russians. It's common knowledge, the fact you overlook it tells me you're either ignorant of that fact or oblivious to it. Labour has attacked them on it several times on the Russian property investor community funding Tories, both party and individuals, maybe you missed that. There were also donations from the Indian Amit Lohia of £2m and an Egyptian Mohamed Mansour to the tune of £5m last year.\n\nLabour acquired £5m from Gary Lubner, also a South African, ironically enough.\n\nI guess you'll now say \"These aren't £100m\" and that's true, but that figure is all rumour, with no terms provided. It could well be over 10 years. Elon Musk has a tendency of overpromising and underdelivering, as men with great ambitions often do.\n\nI should say, that I don't particularly like Farage, though I did vote for Reform. They are the only party that made any effort to reach out to SME's which is this country's sole success story at the minute. Starmer's policies any retard could tell you that they were obviously (and currently are) going to butcher them. The Tories have had 14 years, and all they've done post-Cameron is push big business, though some success in the tech start-ups they can take credit for. The Lib Dems apparently don't believe in economic policies, the Greens are retarded and should be dismissed as a joke party. That leaves only Reform, regrettably..."
