That area turns into a gridlock as soon as anything goes wrong.\n\nIn the same general area, I remember when they were working on Blox, one morning I had to catch the bus from central station to the Black Diamond. It got as far as Christians Brygge and then it just did not move. At all. Eventually, I and several other commuters gave up, asked to be let out and walked the rest of the way."

The traffic planners who re-route the busses do what they can, but they have no influence on the construction work - they just have to try to work around it, and service as many bus stops as possible, while also trying to avoid going through the most congested places."

I know this is hard to believe, but the people working with this are trying to avoid delays.\n\nThe traffic planners don't have any say in the construction works, and often are not informed by the municipality who are normally the ones building. They have to try to find alternative routes, or just accept that there are no alternatives, so the busses must go through the traffic jams that are caused by the road construction work."
