They usually arrive late afternoon so I wasn't too concerned when there was no sign of them earlier in the day. At one point I went to bring the rubbish out and I had to do a double take because there was an Amazon box in my feckin grey bin. I checked my email and there was a confirmation of delivery with a picture of the box in the bin. This was from around 11 in the morning. Me and my husband were both in the house. The fecker didn't bother ringing the doorbell, just fucked it in the bin and left.",

Asked if places could order it in but it was just not to be got.\n\nFor herself she's done all her shopping on Amazon, and for a lot of people who are like her (elderly and/or infirm with limited mobility), delivery is a god send and has allowed her to retain a sense of independence she would otherwise be lacking, but these lads and these companies seemingly couldn't give a fuck about the people who rely on them, and considering the negative comments in this thread, it seems much of this sub feel the same,and it's your own fault if you need to fall back on these online companies.",
