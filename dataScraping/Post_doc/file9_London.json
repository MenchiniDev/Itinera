The police will review this and decide whether to take action. \n\nIn my case, they came round within an hour or so. I hadn't heard anything from my next door neighbour for a day or so and I knew she had been ill, so I was worried. Unfortunately the outcome wasn't good, but at least she hadn't been there long, we were able to take in her cat and help out her family.",

He was meant to meet us for brunch and didn't show. We tried calling him and even went round to knock on his door and no response. It was less than 12 hours, but we called the police for a wellness check and thankfully he was fine. He had decided to sod off the alcohol and drugs and pick up extra shifts at work and was just tired so he slept through our attempts to contact him. The other was our friend who was a new mother but her husband left her three days after giving birth for his side piece. We were doing a meal train to help her and one friend noticed the meals from the day before were left on her door step still (she wouldn't let us in as she wasn't ready for that convo). Again, we reported it and sadly this time it wasn't in time. She had killed herself and the youngest baby already. The other boy had been half drowed and in the end sadly didn't survive.

He will sober up again when he wants to, he may have this all planned out as a week long party. Unless you honestly think that he might attempt suicide (I don't mean drinking or using to death) then send him and e-mail or a long text and explain that you would just appreciate a hello so you know he is alright. Tell him you love him no matter what, and you're thinking about him. I would give it some time....UNLESS he is a suicide risk. \n\nYes reverting to old anti social and addictive ways is shitty, but it's a part of addiction and the 'mental issues'.
