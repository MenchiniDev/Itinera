Or something like that."

    "Body" : "Yes, it's possible. We do have a new tax law about renting, so we have LTR (they have to be at least 10 months long) and STR through AirBnb, booking and similar platforms. You can try to book through platforms for, idk, week or two, and try to come with your landlord to an agreement for a few months to avoid high platform provisions. Good luck!"
