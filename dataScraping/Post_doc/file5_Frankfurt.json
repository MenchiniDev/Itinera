    "body" : "I'm going to be honest, \"craft beer\" is mostly not very good in Germany. You will probably not find any kind of IPA that is anything better than \"ok.\" That being said, there are small local German brewers who make some of the best Helles in the entire world right in the Frankfurt area. I recommend you go to Drinksmith in Sachsenhausen because there will you have both styles available in one place: they have a couple IPAs on tap and they have GetrÃ¤nkeschmied Schmidt Helles on tap.",
