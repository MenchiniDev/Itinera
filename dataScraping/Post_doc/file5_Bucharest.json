    "body" : "It is very unlikely that any of the major car rental agencies are going to allow you to drive the vehicle to/from the Republic of Moldova.  In fact a quick check of Avis Romania website states the following:\n\n>Premium cars (group G), certain vehicles 4x4 / SUV (groups K, O and P) and minibuses with 8/9 seats (group L) cannot leave Romania. \nAll other vehicles can travel only to these European countries (requires prior notification of the office rental Avis): Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia *, Czech Republic, France *, Germany, Greece *, Hungary, Italy *, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia.\n\nMoldova is a high risk country in terms of auto thefts and also outside the EU.  Your best bet is to find a local auto rental company that has an office in Moldova too or a small operator that would be willing to take the risk.   \n\n ",
