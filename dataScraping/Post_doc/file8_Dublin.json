Reddit mods and admins have no way to verify or ensure that people claiming they have a ticket to sell actually have a ticket to sell and will actually sell it to you. REMINDER: Reddit is a relatively anonymous platform ; it's extremely easy to create an account, run a scam, then delete the account and repeat. Do not trust anyone claiming they will sell you a concert ticket. **THIS POST WILL BE REMOVED.**\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Dublin) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
