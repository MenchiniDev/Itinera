Use official TicketMaster resale if possible. Reddit mods and admins have no way to verify or ensure that people claiming they have a ticket to sell actually have a ticket to sell and will actually sell it to you. REMINDER: Reddit is a relatively anonymous platform ; it's extremely easy to create an account, run a scam, then delete the account and repeat. Do not trust anyone claiming they will sell you their ticket. **YOU WILL BE SCAMMED.**\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body" : "**Mod note**\n\nWe sometimes receive messages in modmail about people being scammed on Reddit while selling or buying products, tickets or services.\n\nIt is best not to assume good intent while buying or selling from Redditors. In case you were scammed on Reddit, the moderation team can't help you get your money/stuff back and we can't ban users from Reddit either. We can only ban them from /r/Dublin.\n\nMost people contacting you via private messages are scammers. Beware of any private message or chat message offering to buy or sell stuff.\n\nNew accounts and shadowbanned accounts may be an indicator that someone is trying to scam you, however we have seen scams coming from years-old account as well. Do not assume an account is legit because they've been on Reddit for years and have plenty of karma.\n\nWe recommend against selling or buying stuff on Reddit.\n\nPlatforms like [Toutless](https://toutless.com/) for tickets, or [adverts](https://www.adverts.ie/) for stuff, are better suited, though they are not scam-free.\n\nNote that it is not allowed to use /r/Dublin to sell your stuff or advertise your business. If you must, pay for Reddit Ads. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
