The city of Frankfurt put aside money to rebuild it but so far they have not been able to find a company willing to rebuild it. The city is hopeful that a company can be found; currently the construction work is being tendered. If a company is found them they expect work to start summer 2025.\n\nhttps://www.hessenschau.de/tv-sendung/schwedlerbruecke-in-frankfurt-soll-restauriert-werden,video-204908.html",

    "body" : "[Schwedlerbrücke](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwedlerbrücke). It was a pedestrian bridge that would connect Schwedlerstrasse with Ostpark.\n\nDesigned by Johann Wilhelm Schwedler and constructed in 1910. Schwedler was an important 19th Century German engineer and architect who also designed the roof of the Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\nIt was closed in 2011, and partially deconstructed in 2016. The missing pieces are still there, sitting on the ground. Plans to rebuild and restore the bridge have been repeatedly postponed since then, but the city still intends to follow through in the near future.",
