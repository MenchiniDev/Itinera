    "Body" : "You live in Senamiestis, possibly old house which has shitty insulation (if any). And when you pay for m2 of heating, not as a flat but as a whole building, energy costs is divided by m2 for each flat. So you will pay a metric fuckton of money. Get a flat in a renovated house, or newly built one, you will pay \\~100 Euros/month for everything + rent."

    "Body" : "You did not mention how much is the bill or broke it down! So I have no clue what to say about it. However, you should be very aware before renting that the bills are supper important factor to consider, type of building, type of heating, Insulation, does the son reach the place, is there high administration fees. Often people see the place and fall in love with it that wanna rent it asap, but you really have to ask the landlord or the broker to show you previous bills, do not trust \" it should be around 80‚Ç¨/90‚Ç¨\". Good luck"
