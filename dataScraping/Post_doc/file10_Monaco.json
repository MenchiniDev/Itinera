    "Body" : "Maybourne Riviera is open all year round and so is Cap d'Estel. Hotels that close for the winter (like MC Beach Hotel) will already be closed by now, usually they close in October/November. \n\nI suggest Ceto (the Maybourne Riviera restaurant) for a good restaurant with a view, and I suggest to go for lunch because it's much nicer. You can also go to Mirazur which is owned by the same chef. \n\nThere is also the classic Chevre d'Or, food is kind of classic French and not my favourite for that kind of place, but the views are stunning too.\n\nThe Grill in Hotel de Paris has a beautiful view too, especially form the side terrace where you have the private dining room."
