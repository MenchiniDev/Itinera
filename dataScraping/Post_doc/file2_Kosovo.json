Even trying to argue with them is pointless because the only \"truth\" they accept is what their delusional propaganda states. One side of Serbia doesnt believe war crimes against Albanians took place, the other side knows but doesnt care and wants to do it again.\n\nStarlink being up in Kosovo is good. We will just continue to move forward and these Serb patriots on the internet can continue spaming \"UN1244\" and \"Kosovo i Metohije\" as much as they like.",

    "body" : "Serbia isn't russias little brother for no reason. They've copied everything from the ruskies. From the doctrine of the Zar to Stalin & Putin. Mass deportation, ethnic cleansing & brutally beating down every uprising of those who don't give up their nationality & ethnicity. The same probaganda that russia applies on it's people, the same rethoric is used by serbia. Serbias president Vucic was Milosevics probaganda minister. An ultra nationalist with one single goal: to exterminate everything non serbian. Can you imagine Joseph Goebbels being germanys president 25 years after Hitler? Unfortunately people become very stupid in such environment therefore the casual serb buys all their bullshit. \nFor example the old question who was there first. Slavic migration to the balkans happened in the 6th & 7th century A.D. Illyrian tribes though lived there centuries before. One Illyrian tribe called the \"Albani\" was first mentioned by greek mathematcian & geographer Claudius Ptolemy who lived roughly 100-170 A.D. yet you'll find dozens comments on social media posts, youtube videos etc related to balkan topics of serbians claiming they've been the first there because serbia existed longer because albania only exists since 1912 (when it gained independence from the ottomans).\nLiterally takes 5min to google those information but serbians rather belive what fairy tale grandpa told.",
