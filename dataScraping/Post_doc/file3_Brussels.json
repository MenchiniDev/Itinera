Many people arrive alone, for a job / internship / study / ... and you can really feel the openness to meet new people here. It's not London or Paris. For most Belgians outside the city it's an unfamiliar place. Weather can be gray & wet, and public transport can be unreliable. All these things really guide people to the real value there is in building a small community and starting to feel like they belong here. Given most people were new & alone here one day, even established groups of friends are very eager to invite new members in, and adopt them in their circle. I truly think the level of depth in connections to be made here is quite unique.",

I love that I get a decent apartment by paying 1k whereas i have friends in paris, ams, or berlin which with the same amount have little studios. Taxes are high its true, but overall you can find a good balance as there is an interesting job market. I really want to mention cinemas here. I really love the variety of small, independent cinemas. The amount of film festivals and everything that allows you to touch independent films. And also people here can be quite nice. I know people from all over the world and i have created my little friend families here.

If you don’t work in the institutions there is very little career opportunities which means that there is a high concentration of bureaucrats.

Basically you’re either Belgian or your work in the institutions (aka the Brussel bubble).\n\nThe architecture goes from charming to terrible and since it is a small city the terrible is hard to escape.

Brussels has almost none of this, and it's great. It really removes a lot of pretention from foreigners who move to Brussels, which helps with the culture of the city on the whole. \n\nThis is probably helped by the fact that everyone learns that the correct attitude to take towards Brussels is to complain about it and to massively exaggerate its flaws. If rolling my eyes at this all the time is the price I pay for a city without much of a yuppie expat culture, then I'll pay it happily. \n\nOn a more serious note, I think Brussels offers a ton of activities and events for a city of its size, which is in no small part thanks to the density of (especially European) foreigner groups. It's expensive compared to much of the rest of the world, but compared to London, Paris, or Amsterdam, it's quite cheap. I would say that you get a lot of \"bang for your buck\" out of life here.",

You need to see the same people, the same places, and listen to the stories from before. Brussels is intimately connected with its past as a poor, yet vibrant, musical, and theatrical city. There are ghosts of this past everywhere, but very few people still know where to look.\n\n> like can one expat feel really from the city, connected with the culture, and is possible to start a family here and have like 'Brussels' connection?\n\nMany locals have precious little to do with \"expats\". \n\nWhile I obviously can't speak for all locals, see it like this: They're people who move in, tend to live in one area (Schuman), tend to work for the same employer (EU-centric jobs), generally speak a foreign language (English), stick to themselves, complain about everything (housing, administration... you name it), and leave after a year or two because they got some other opportunity elsewhere. \n\nWould *you* be lifelong friends with someone if you knew there was a time limit?\n\nMany locals limit themselves to being acquaintances.\n\nIf you want to get to know the *real* Brussels, I don't think you can do it in English. It simply won't happen.",

I do believe so. I agree with u/SharkyTendencies on the language; a basic understanding of French will help a lot, but I've seen people starting families here after moving & slowly starting to like it more as a place to settle down. \n\nThings that can help to \"become Bruxelois\" IMO - non-exhaustive, just some ideas: join an independent sports club and go there regularly at the same time to meet the same people (climbing is great for that), talk to owners of small cafés and restaurants, go to boutique movie theaters rather than the big chains, go vote (big one to mentally feel \"part of the city\"), explore the venues for arts & culture (e.g. musical concerts, ...), go watch a game of USG, talk to strangers, invite friends of friends and join events by friends of friends, go read a book at one of these old school \"Brussels\" cafés while people watching, ... In short, as in every city, honestly, get out there. You're paying premium for real estate in a big vibrant city with tons to do at your doorstep, make use if it to the fullest!",
