I have been at this for two days now, constantly refreshing and trying to get tickets. They really do sell out within seconds. Milliseconds. Tickets are released every 20 minutes according to time slot- at the :50, :10, and :30 minute mark starting at 8:50 am Rome time. I recommend watching the clock app on your phone and refreshing the page exactly at the :59th second. \n\n\nAfter two days of trying to secure these tickets, it’s now 4am and I am slightly delirious and in disbelief. I’ve had the tickets emailed to me but there is no option to add to wallet or get an official digital copy of the ticket. Can anyone confirm that the pdf version of the tickets will suffice on the day of the tour?"

After constant refreshing of the web page for 2 hours, amidst heavy web traffic, I gave up and went to bed to discover in the morning that tickets were being released by time slot but sold out immediately. Several times, I was able to get 3 tickets in my cart - 2 shy of what I needed. I tried every subsequent time slot and refreshed between times to see if any tickets were released from carts by customers who didn't get what they were looking for.\n\nIn the end, I got 5 tickets for the 24H ONLY ARENA (but can't actually see how they are any different from the 24h – COLOSSEUM, ROMAN FORUM, PALATINE tickets which are more plentiful, but the same price).\n\nOne thing I noticed on the tickets sent by email is that we are to use is the Stern Entrance which may or may not have a shorter wait time. All in all, it was a frustrating process but I do have basic tickets which I am still grateful for. I do recommend trial runs on the days before so that you can make your selections fast and press <CONTINUE>. Once tickets are in your cart, you'll have breathing room to add names to tickets and check out. Best of luck!"

I asked guy in some yellow shirt at the first entry point and he told me that he can let her in, but rest of security check or whatsoever not gonna let her go and that we need to wait in line tommorow to buy new ticket. I’m so nervous right now and mad to be honest beacuse it’s such a clear situation and I see no reason for slight tolerance in our case. Whats your opionion, is there still a posibility that they will let us both in?

I know I'm way too late to get the \"Full experience + underground\" tickets.\n\nPlease explain the difference between the \"FULL EXPERIENCE TICKET WITH ENTRY TO THE ARENA OF THE COLOSSEUM\" ticket versus the other tickets? I understand that the \"full experience\" ticket includes the arena along with the first two floors of the Colosseum + Palatine Hill + Roman Forum for 48 hours, which sounds like the second-best option to the underground tickets.\n\nTherefore, my questions are:\n\n1. Why does it release only a week in advance as opposed to the other tickets which are released 30 days in advance?\n2. why is there so much more availability for this full experience ticket compared to the other tickets if it seems to be the better deal? Even the 24hour Arena only ticket is more sold out than this one.\n\nI feel like it's too good to be true and I'm getting duped! I don't want to wait a week before when I want to get tickets and then realize was missing something and then not be able to get another ticket due to them all being sold out!\n\nEDIT: I just read a few comments below someone asked a similar question.

I pulled it up on my laptop, signed into my Par-C account, it showed the two tickets in my cart, so I proceeded to check-out and it worked.

I was learning a little Italian. It was a complete waste and also in the underground guided tour there is nothing much to see really; just a few passageways and the lifts that are reconstructed to lift the animals up. The official guide stopped the tour when we reached the arena. Whereas I noticed for the third party tours their guide took them through all the exhibits. It is actually better to use the official free audio guide and buy regular tickets but for some reason I was unable to download it on my phone."

If your ticket timing is not far apart and you are not carrying any big bags or bags which require scanning, the staff might just use his/her discretion to let you in.\n\nWorst case if the staff refuses to let you in, the VALADIER entrance (for the 24H normal ticket on the opposite side of the STERN entrance) is less than 400m apart from the STERN entrance (for the 24H Only Arena ticket).

Some say just to wait it out but still I don’t want to risk not getting any waiting for the last minute for the tickets to be released so instead, (this is what I did:)\n\nI bought the most “basic” one. (18€) The Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill tickets instead. Based on my research, You can access the floors which I think is already suitable for us. Paying extra for the Arena didn’t seem quite worth it for ME (plus the risk of waiting a week before ticket release) the more I research about the difference between the two. \n\nI guess the Full Experience will benefit you if you need the 48 hours and of course the Arena itself. The Arena will be the platform you see in the recent colosseum photos. Which you can have an almost 360 view unlike when you’re in just the floors itself. Also the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill is I believe huge in size and it might take more hours to explore thats where you’ll need the 48 hours if you have time. \n\nPs. I haven’t been yet. Will be travelling on September. Just sharing my own thoughts on the matter. :)\n\nI hope I did help in some way(?) or someone else who needs a little info. 🙂 Have a safe travel!"

    "Body" : "Is the entry time far apart?\n\nI did the Attic first and took my time at the Attic then took the same lift down to the common passageway (don't know what is the correct name but I am referring to the common area after the security checks with ticket office, toilets, lifts, various queue poles for different ticket holders etc) to get to the waiting area for my underground guided tour. However, the guided underground tour is only 45 minutes and the Arena platform is only the size of 3 basketball courts. You don't really need an hour to take all angles on the Arena platform. So if your entry time is far apart, there is nothing much to do at the common passageway.\n\nFrom what I experienced, as long as you don't take the stairs up to the second floor of the Colosseum open to all ticket holders (except Arena only ticket holders), you can still make your way back to the common passageway. But once you take the stairs up to the second floor, you can only follow the one-way route to the final exit (which does not bring you back to the common passageway)."

I'm not sure if time slots are the same each day of the week, but the weekday and weekend slots were different when I was booking.   \n\nThere are two ticket types that go on sale one week ahead of time - this self-guided option [https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience/](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience/) : and the Moonlight guided tour [https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/una-notte-al-colosseo/](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/una-notte-al-colosseo/) .  \n\nStart tooling around the Ticketing Homepage  [https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/) until you know what you want to do, and then set your alarm to get into the site right before the ticketing opens for that day.

I don’t see it on their site and many have told me you can only go with 3rd party tour guides. Where did you purchase the tickets? 2) The 3rd party tours I’ve seen are $160-180 a person so I’m wondering if it’s worth it.  From your experience it sounds like it’s not but I read you saw other groups taking other routes. Did it seem like it was worth it for them ?"
