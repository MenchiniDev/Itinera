I have been at this for two days now, constantly refreshing and trying to get tickets. They really do sell out within seconds. Milliseconds. Tickets are released every 20 minutes according to time slot- at the :50, :10, and :30 minute mark starting at 8:50 am Rome time. I recommend watching the clock app on your phone and refreshing the page exactly at the :59th second. \n\n\nAfter two days of trying to secure these tickets, it’s now 4am and I am slightly delirious and in disbelief. I’ve had the tickets emailed to me but there is no option to add to wallet or get an official digital copy of the ticket. Can anyone confirm that the pdf version of the tickets will suffice on the day of the tour?",

Guess I got a month left to grind on Duolingo.\n\nI’d like to add that refreshing the page was indeed NOT my friend. Few attempts (5 ish mins?) of doing so ended up getting me kicked out of the website with a tiny “Forbidden” message in the upper left hand corner. Luckily disconnecting from WiFi, and connecting through mobile data hotspot allowed me to get back in and continue trying.\n\nA pro tip that I found on Reddit when panicking after getting forbidden was to click back and forth through months on the calendar, as it updates every 1-2 mins. That helped me stay on the page and still update it without having to refresh the whole page and make the website think I’m a bot. Annoying but atleast it worked!\n\nGoodluck to everyone else fighting against the website to get their tickets!",

Be aware there will be people trying to sneak in the queue. One family kept on trying and people had to be a bit forceful with them but I saw that a couple further down the queue just let them in. This didn’t affect us but imo is really inconsiderate of the people behind the couple who have been queuing for almost 2 hours to get in. I had to tell a man trying to squeeze in beside me the end of the queue is a lot further back and he seemed to take it well. \n\nAs we were leaving around 12:00, the end of queue looked much much shorter. I’m not sure if I would recommend trying later in the day as I didn’t want to take the chance and be told they have tickets. But perhaps might be worth trying if you couldn’t get up early to join it before 08:30",

After constant refreshing of the web page for 2 hours, amidst heavy web traffic, I gave up and went to bed to discover in the morning that tickets were being released by time slot but sold out immediately. Several times, I was able to get 3 tickets in my cart - 2 shy of what I needed. I tried every subsequent time slot and refreshed between times to see if any tickets were released from carts by customers who didn't get what they were looking for.\n\nIn the end, I got 5 tickets for the 24H ONLY ARENA (but can't actually see how they are any different from the 24h – COLOSSEUM, ROMAN FORUM, PALATINE tickets which are more plentiful, but the same price).\n\nOne thing I noticed on the tickets sent by email is that we are to use is the Stern Entrance which may or may not have a shorter wait time. All in all, it was a frustrating process but I do have basic tickets which I am still grateful for. I do recommend trial runs on the days before so that you can make your selections fast and press <CONTINUE>. Once tickets are in your cart, you'll have breathing room to add names to tickets and check out. Best of luck!",

It’s so clearly  honest mistake beacuse why would anyone buy two tickets for themself on the same day with 15 minutes difference in beetwen and sister and I have last name. I asked guy in some yellow shirt at the first entry point and he told me that he can let her in, but rest of security check or whatsoever not gonna let her go and that we need to wait in line tommorow to buy new ticket. I’m so nervous right now and mad to be honest beacuse it’s such a clear situation and I see no reason for slight tolerance in our case. Whats your opionion, is there still a posibility that they will let us both in? Is there some info or complaint desk or something similar or some staff with higher authority then those guys at the entry point that I can go to to explain myself and potentionally get permsion for sister to go in?

I know I'm way too late to get the \"Full experience + underground\" tickets.\n\nPlease explain the difference between the \"FULL EXPERIENCE TICKET WITH ENTRY TO THE ARENA OF THE COLOSSEUM\" ticket versus the other tickets? I understand that the \"full experience\" ticket includes the arena along with the first two floors of the Colosseum + Palatine Hill + Roman Forum for 48 hours, which sounds like the second-best option to the underground tickets.\n\nTherefore, my questions are:\n\n1. Why does it release only a week in advance as opposed to the other tickets which are released 30 days in advance?\n2. why is there so much more availability for this full experience ticket compared to the other tickets if it seems to be the better deal? Even the 24hour Arena only ticket is more sold out than this one.\n\nI feel like it's too good to be true and I'm getting duped! I don't want to wait a week before when I want to get tickets and then realize was missing something and then not be able to get another ticket due to them all being sold out!\n\nEDIT: I just read a few comments below someone asked a similar question.

In my first attempt, I made it to check-out (on my phone) and signed into my Par-C account because I kept receiving an error. I pulled it up on my laptop, signed into my Par-C account, it showed the two tickets in my cart, so I proceeded to check-out and it worked. But to my disappointment, somehow it purchased two regular full experience tickets for tomorrow... My husband was watching and did confirm that I had the correct Underground Tickets and the correct date in the cart, so I don't know what happened. I kept checking back though, and was finally able to get 2 of the correct Underground tickets. I just paid twice as much for them I suppose.

Or will they not let me in anywhere at all until my time slot because the ticket won’t have been activated?\n\nI know I can visit most of the sites the day after but my stress is that 75 minutes isn’t enough time to do the arena, underground and main building, so I’m just trying to plan! 🤦🏻‍♀️😣\n\nHas anyone had the same issue?

I was learning a little Italian. It was a complete waste and also in the underground guided tour there is nothing much to see really; just a few passageways and the lifts that are reconstructed to lift the animals up. The official guide stopped the tour when we reached the arena. Whereas I noticed for the third party tours their guide took them through all the exhibits. It is actually better to use the official free audio guide and buy regular tickets but for some reason I was unable to download it on my phone.",

    "body" : "Hello! I was the one who asked the same question with yours and I have the same exact thoughts as you have. Some say just to wait it out but still I don’t want to risk not getting any waiting for the last minute for the tickets to be released so instead, (this is what I did:)\n\nI bought the most “basic” one. (18€) The Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill tickets instead. Based on my research, You can access the floors which I think is already suitable for us. Paying extra for the Arena didn’t seem quite worth it for ME (plus the risk of waiting a week before ticket release) the more I research about the difference between the two. \n\nI guess the Full Experience will benefit you if you need the 48 hours and of course the Arena itself. The Arena will be the platform you see in the recent colosseum photos. Which you can have an almost 360 view unlike when you’re in just the floors itself. Also the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill is I believe huge in size and it might take more hours to explore thats where you’ll need the 48 hours if you have time. \n\nPs. I haven’t been yet. Will be travelling on September. Just sharing my own thoughts on the matter. :)\n\nI hope I did help in some way(?) or someone else who needs a little info. 🙂 Have a safe travel!",

However, the guided underground tour is only 45 minutes and the Arena platform is only the size of 3 basketball courts. You don't really need an hour to take all angles on the Arena platform. So if your entry time is far apart, there is nothing much to do at the common passageway.\n\nFrom what I experienced, as long as you don't take the stairs up to the second floor of the Colosseum open to all ticket holders (except Arena only ticket holders), you can still make your way back to the common passageway. But once you take the stairs up to the second floor, you can only follow the one-way route to the final exit (which does not bring you back to the common passageway).",

Where did you purchase the tickets? 2) The 3rd party tours I’ve seen are $160-180 a person so I’m wondering if it’s worth it.  From your experience it sounds like it’s not but I read you saw other groups taking other routes. Did it seem like it was worth it for them ?",

It took a lot of time to get them haha. Honestly, we would've gone with the italian tour tickets, that's still the full experience but for 16 euro's extra. That is still leagues cheaper than via 3rd party sellers. And then you can either choose to go with the tour or just not and explore yourself with an audio tour or info on your phone.",

Plus the staff didn't enforce any time limit on us.\n\nI would probably try to buy the underground tickets again for my next trip as we only had 45 minutes in one visit.",

The Attic Experience does not include Underground but from what I've read DOES give access to the Arena but I read you need to go to Gate 12 when you arrive to get a sep sticker.  That was a few months ago, not sure if the process changed when they moved away from COOP Culture to Colosseo.it.  The Attic option (unguided) is found on the Individuals tab here [https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/categorie/singoli-1-8-persone/rom](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/categorie/singoli-1-8-persone/rom) .\n\n  \nThe Underground option (unguided) is found here [https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience-sotterranei-e-arena/](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience-sotterranei-e-arena/)\n\nThe Underground **Guided** option is here [https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience-sotterranei-e-arena-visita-guidata/](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience-sotterranei-e-arena-visita-guidata/) , it's part of the Guided options tab [https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/categorie/visite-guidate/](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/categorie/visite-guidate/) I don't see a *Guided* option for the Attico experience.

Yes, you'll get locked out, for an hour it seemed?? - if you refresh too frequently.  I got locked out once on both days of trying tickets.  Were I to do it over again I'd have a device open for each experience I was trying to get.  One on wifi and one using Data if you're data's fast.
