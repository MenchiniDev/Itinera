From there, we would like to take a public bus to the hotel (it's a half hour to walk which is a little far with luggage and kid in December). I know the bus we need to take, but I'm getting stumped on trying to find out where to buy bus tickets. It seems as if there is no way to buy physical/paper bus tickets either at the airport or at BSI Bus Terminal. Is that true? Are there no ticket vending machines? I tried to download the app but it doesn't work with a US mobile number. So is the only option to pay in cash (which would likely mean overpaying since we'd have to withdraw cash at the airport and then pay with whatever bill the ATM spits out)? Grateful for any tips!",

Book ticket, boarding pass on phone, valid passport, tiny bag of carry-on luggage, tinier man bag, get to airport, sorted.\nBut since then we’ve had Covid and Brexit so I now have some questions! Can this group help? Fingers crossed!\n\n1 I always got to Keflavik, picked the right-hand bus booth, and got the coach to BSL. Walking distance to downtown RVK, easy, just past the lake. But I heard there’s been changes? Not just because of the volcano? \nDo the buses still run regularly/constantly and do they still terminate at BSL?\n\n2 I’ve heard the local buses - always fussy about exact change - have got worse? Any feedback on the buses? I often used them to visit friends in Kopavogur. Is there an app I can use to pay?\n\n3 Finally - the main one - I used to stay with friends but they’ve since had a baby. Any recommendations for cheap (hah!) clean hotels (with ensuite) near to downtown? \n\nÞakka þér fyrir!",
