    "Body" : "This is a pretty good idea. OP could take the ferry that leaves in the morning from Helsinki, then have a few hours in Tallinn and come back.\n\nIt's really odd that the Christmas market in Helsinki closes before Christmas, would be nice to visit on Christmas Eve morning I think. Or maybe that's cause I'm from Turku originally and am used to leaving the house before midday to go to the Christmas Peace declaration and then to have glÃ¶gi somewhere downtown.\n\nI'm not religious but I like the Christmas Carol events they have at churches. There's this in English in the main cathedral on Christmas Day at 4pm if you're interested OP.

It's really nice on winter/Christmas times cause you can swim and look at the lights everywhere and then have a sauna. [https://allasseapool.fi/?lang=en](https://allasseapool.fi/?lang=en)"
