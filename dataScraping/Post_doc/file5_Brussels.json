I wish they had something similar, but valid for a year.\n\nWhy do we have this ridiculous Diabolo fee? A great decision by our politicians to engage in a binding [contract till 2047](https://www.brusselstimes.com/235966/why-passengers-have-to-pay-extra-for-trains-to-brussels-airport), and asked a private company to build the tunnel. Which didn't change anything for those travelling to and from the Brussels city by the way. An estimate last year showed it already cost us around 1 billion. \n\nInstead of building this, they could have built the entire tram connection which was [promised in 2013](https://www.werkenaandering.be/en/werken-aan/openbaar-vervoer/luchthaventram) at a cost of 100 million â‚¬.\n\nSeems like they'll finally start building the tram in 2025, with 2030 as an operational deadline. But who knows. /endrant",

If you take the bus FROM the airport, it's a special ticket of around 8 euros I think. So I just use my normal Mobib yearly pass to go and a single ticket to come back. Round trip is then 10 euros, which is still more affordable than most other options.",
