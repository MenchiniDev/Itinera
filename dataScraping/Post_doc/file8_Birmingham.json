    "Body" : "These are white LED street lights, but something you may not know is that LEDs can’t be white, LEDs emit only one frequency of light but white is the entire visible spectrum, so what they do is take LEDs that emit ultraviolet light and put them behind a covering of phosphorescent coated material which, when hit with UV light, glows brightly white. The coating is degrading and thus UV light is spilling out, making the area blue/purple"
