If you take a look at population density of central Vilnius (i.e. excluding neigbourhoods like Naujoji Vilnia, Grigi≈°kƒós, etc) the density is actually not far off other large urban centers in Europe.\n\n\\---\n\nbtw if removing the \"turn right on red\" rule stopped at least one death, it's worth it. Don't forget that some vehicles have a large turning radius (buses, trucks) and they are extremely dangerous if pedestrians go under their rear wheels. There have been people who died on right turns for this exact reason and speed doesn't have much to do with it.",

Face it - Vilnius is badly designed, the last Mayor and his staff were absolute tools. And this problem will only get worse as Vilnius will only expand",
