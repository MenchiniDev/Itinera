This is not really difficult to sort out and you already have the hardest part done (a lease). She should be able to come back and apply right away. But how much time is left? Did she leave right at 90 days?"

If you want an Immigration Services consultant then I would strongly recommend Move to Prague. Good luck!\n\nP.S. - If you do go to MTP, it might be worth asking them what legal action you can take against the company. Rescinding offer letters without good reason is not very common in CZ."

And the application given in person, might require a in person pick up once approved. But this is just what I recall from many years ago, please contact the authorities and ask. Good luck"

If there is no clause about this, then normal rules apply for notice of termination, and 2 months pay are due to the employee of the contract"
