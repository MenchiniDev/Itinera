    "Body" : "I really like M&B Moes in Merl. \n\nBTW the way it usually works is that you go to your GP and they give you a physiotherapy prescription AND a prescription for a scan and/or a referral to a specialist (but you can usually go to a specialist of your choice). From my experience a physio won't give you advice on whether you need surgery, a specialist will do that."
