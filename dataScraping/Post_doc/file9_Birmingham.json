Also, coal isn't just polluting in a typical emissions sense - it's also the worst energy source from a radiation perspective, The byproducts released from coal burning plants accounts for more environmental radiation than all nuclear disasters combined given coal is naturally radioactive.\n\nFukushima was less than 15 years ago so the long-long term cancer rate data is still yet TBD, but for deaths in that timeframe - 1 person died from cancer 4 years later (51 deaths occurred as a result of the evacuation of 164,000 surrounding the plant), and 6 were suspected to have gotten cancer/leukemia as a result of their exposure. The WHO found In 2013, that \"residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels\".\n\nCompare that to rural Kentucky, where residents who are close to coal mines or plants having cancer rates about 50% higher than rural Kentucky residents who are not near coal mines/plants.\n\nCoal production is extremely fucking dirty.",
