The WHO found In 2013, that \"residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels\".\n\nCompare that to rural Kentucky, where residents who are close to coal mines or plants having cancer rates about 50% higher than rural Kentucky residents who are not near coal mines/plants.\n\nCoal production is extremely fucking dirty.",
