Train takes about an hour.\n\n- Nice recently restored park around an old sanatorium\n- trails going from the edge of the town through dunes, pine forests and swamps. Swamps are quite pretty when frozen\n\n\nA little further in the same direction is Tukums\n- center is quite nice\n- Jaunmoku pils and/or Durbes pils if you like castles\n- Cinevilla if you find a way to get there",

You could get off the train in Majori (30 min from Riga central station), as that area will have most cafes and restaurants to choose from. You can go for a stroll on the beach and walk along the little residential streets where you'll see many old beautiful wooden houses/villas; Jūrmala is famous for this type of architecture.",

Definetly my go to place",
