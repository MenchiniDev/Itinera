When people give each other socks or shampoos, no one asks the question of what is festive about these things. My text says that these postcards with Helsinki landscapes can be a good addition to the gift. And since the nearest holiday is Christmas, it can be a good addition to a Christmas gift. Don’t be so picky, if you don’t like it, you can pass by and not leave your comment.",

So I do what I can. The next time I definitely will make it better, it’s the part of life and experience. If all people in the world have such a negative reaction to things, I will be disappointed, because I come to people with good emotions and mood and expect the same from them.

You are on the internet and people express their opinions without filters. And I think all feedback here has been constructive. And in Finland you will not get the fake American positive feedback mindset anyway.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add that I definitely think you have talent. And I don’t want you to loose motivation because of people’s negative attitudes. Believe in yourself and filter out the negativity when it is risking to hurt your self confidence.",

I don’t want to try to please all people by drawing something very popular, as many people do, first of all I draw what I like, if someone wants to buy my art or place an order, because they will like my style - good. Artists are also people and want to eat and live in a warm place. This is the little that is left of the fair in which I was offered to participate. If someone finds them beautiful and wants to buy them, it’s cool and I’ll be glad, because for me they are very beautiful. Not everyone has the opportunity to buy original paintings.",

So Tove Jansson wasn’t a ”true” artist because she sold quite a lot of her art for different purposes. Did she sell her soul, as you say, by doing that? Also this is how illustrators in general make money. Are they betraying something? What a silly concept. Plus not everyone has money to buy expensive original pieces from artists so alternatively a really good way to support them is buying prints for example.",

I have never said that artists can’t make money with their art. It’s usually a sign you are a very good artist if you can find financial sustainability from making art. First you need to be able to make real art though, and that’s not for everyone.",

Especially when you say there are only a limited amount of prints. Saying that is just giving potential customers an illusion of value, and might be considered bad faith. \n\nSo because you said marketing is bad, and I brought up your card selling strategy as being marketing too, you are now angry at me. My first intention was only to help, saying those cards won’t sell at this time of the year. \n\nAlso you are blaming others for negativity while you are only focusing on the negative others say. I don’t know what insecurities bring that up, but try to forgot that and focus on the positive. \n\nIt will help as what you are trying to make a living with is definitely not easy, but I respect you for trying.",

Or at least I buy prints to support the artist and get their art on my walls or delight my friends on a special day. For example when it comes to digital artist it’s not really possible to buy the original piece so print it is. In my opinion, you’re not less of an artist if you promote your work. In fact, I would highly suggest an artist learn a bit about marketing to make it easier for people to find their works and build an audience. \n\nAnd for OP don’t get bummed out by the negative comments. You are really talented!",
