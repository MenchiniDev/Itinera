Just for some p\\*ssy?  \n\nEven when I was 21 and could throw down for 8 hours a day, it made NO sense to waste 50% (or more of my money) on \"ONE\" girl.  If I could throw down 12 hours a day, it would start to make economic sense, but only 8 hours?  Also, +99.99% of girls can NOT and will NOT throw down for 8 hours a day...every day.\n\nIt's like a house being ‚Ç¨10 million, but you can only spend 8 hours in it a day.  How does that make sense?\n\nNot to mention the repetition of it all.  I can't even eat chicken on my diet 3 days in a row.  Why am I going to put 50% of my wealth on something that I will get tired of in a few days, or at the most, weeks?\n\nWhat are these girls thinking?  Are they thinking?\n\nI've been confused by this my entire life, and if I ask the girls to explain themselves, they start calling me horrible names :)",
