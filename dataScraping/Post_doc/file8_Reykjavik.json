Everything will be dead between 11-11:50, as everyone will be inside watching the new years special. But after that you can expect a great fireworks show, just try and find a good vantage point(Hallgrímskirkja, Arnarhóll etc.) The bars/clubs will be open, but might be packed, it will either be a great time or miserable, depending on weather. I don't think we have any special New Year's celebrations, since most Icelanders eat at home and then watch the new years special and then shoot fireworks at home and most people have a party at home.",
