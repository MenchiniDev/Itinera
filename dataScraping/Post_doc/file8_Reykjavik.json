    "Body" : "you could try to find a restaurant on [dineout.is](http://dineout.is), but you could also be a bit late to find a place that has any availability. Everything will be dead between 11-11:50, as everyone will be inside watching the new years special. But after that you can expect a great fireworks show, just try and find a good vantage point(Hallgrímskirkja, Arnarhóll etc.) The bars/clubs will be open, but might be packed, it will either be a great time or miserable, depending on weather. I don't think we have any special New Year's celebrations, since most Icelanders eat at home and then watch the new years special and then shoot fireworks at home and most people have a party at home."

    "Body" : "i was there over NYE 2021-2022. it was amazing. but beware, the entire city shuts down from 9-midnight. every bar. every restaurant. we were running around at 8:30 just trying to find something to take out because every place was jammed with people trying to eat before the break. i guess there is this Icelandic TV show (like Dick Clark) that everyone watches. the bars can't be open until 120:00am, so we just went back to our hotel room to chill. \n\nbut the fireworks were amazing. they put Chicago's 4th of July celebrations to shame."
