Otherwise you‚Äôll need a paper ticket, and that‚Äôs annoying. It‚Äôs very easy to get around here. Trams are the best. Subways are great. I almost never use buses.\n\nDownload the Rekola app if you want to rent bikes (I think there are several companies, but Rikola are the pink ones)\n\nA beer cost between 40-60czk. You are in a tourist trap if you‚Äôre paying more.\n\nYou should tip ~10% at restaurants. They usually won‚Äôt ask you if you want to tip, nor will they have a place to leave a tip afterwards. You need to tell the server you want to add the tip BEFORE you pay.\n\nEveryone uses contactless cards here. People will look at you crazy if you don‚Äôt have one.  Use Apple Pay or Google Pay to avoid awkwardness if your card doesn‚Äôt support contactless.\n\nNot all restaurants/bars take cards. It‚Äôs a good idea to carry a bit of cash on you.\n\nUber works here. I also suggest downloading Bolt. It‚Äôs usually cheaper than Uber (but the same thing)\n\nThere are almost no free public restrooms. Be prepared to pay approximately 10-20czk. Some places take cards (contactless), but not always. The exceptions are Palladium and OC Novy Smichov (both shopping malls with free/clean toilets).\n\nUnfortunately I don‚Äôt have a lot of Czech restaurant recommendations. But try to eat these things at a Czech restaurant. They are usually really good:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tSteak tartar\n\t‚Ä¢\tSvickova\n\t‚Ä¢\tRoasted duck\n\t‚Ä¢\tKolache\n\t‚Ä¢\tKoleno (huge roasted pork knee)\n\t‚Ä¢\tKulajda (mushroom soup)\n\nDay Trips/Additional Places\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tKutna Hora Ossuary (day trip only)- bone ossuary (amazing)\n\t‚Ä¢\tKarlovy Vary\n\t‚Ä¢\tBrno\n\t‚Ä¢\tCesky Krumlov (small but very beautiful, but kind of far and maybe not worth it if limited on time)\n\t‚Ä¢\tZlute Lazne (private swimming area)\n\t‚Ä¢\tPruhonice chateau/park (about an hour outside of Prague ‚Äî really beautiful)\n\t‚Ä¢\tKarlstejn Castle",

With 1000 kc you can get breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, and still have enough for a Trdeln√≠k or something. You can even spend less or more depending on your standards but I'd say 1000 per day is way over enough for everyone (1000 kc is about 40$)",
