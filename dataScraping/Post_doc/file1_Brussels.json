    "body" : "Hi everyone, I'm sure I'm not the first and I definitely won't be the last to write something like this.\n\nTL:DR My bag with valuables worth 1000€+ was stolen, the police didn't help, I'd like to report it online but I'm not a resident of Belgium. How can I report it?\n\n***\n\nThe long story:\n\nI was travelling by flixbus from Paris to the Netherlands and had a two hour break at Noord. As it was raining I went into the train station to seek shelter. This man came up to me asking for money and whilst I was answering, another person took my bag from next to me and ran. I realised when it was already too late.\n\nIn the bag I had my passport and ID card (I already know the police will do nothing for these), a laptop, chargers, glasses etc. \n\nI found two police officers in the station who said they would do nothing. They even advised me to NOT go to the police station by Noord as it was too dangerous, but yet they wouldn't go with me. Instead I had to get a hotel as I could no longer travel without ID. I called the Commissariat in the city centre who said it was not their area. I called another Commissariat who forwarded me to 112 who then forwarded me to 101, who then told me to go to another Commissariat over 3km away. I went as soon as possible only to find out, open my arrival, that they only took emergencies. I explained the situation nevertheless and they gave me an appointment in the morning at 8am. I went back in the morning and once there they said they couldn't report the IDs as stolen as the could not believe I was me and that I required a document from the consulate. They also said they would not process the theft of the other items as they did not want to do it twice.\n\nI then went to the consulate who said that the police always do this and that this was not true. So in the end my IDs are reported as \"missing\" not stolen.\n\nDespite this I went back to the police station by Noord and they took the claim for theft of the other items after a lot of back and forth but I never got a report number or anything...\n\nIn the end I had to leave Brussels and now I am left with no news. I'd like to report the incident online so that I can have a document to claim insurance if possible. Can I report this online even if I am not a resident of Belgium, if so, how?",

Next to the ongoing police investigation I'm trying to cycle around BXL looking for likely spots where the van might have been dumped. One of the hypotheses is that the van got stolen only to be dumped a couple of kilometers further down to road, in a shady spot so the thieves have all the time in the world to raid the van. Alternatively, someone might have stolen the van to have a place to crash at some shady corner of BXL. **Can anyone give any advice on where to look for possible dumping places? I'm thinking of specific parkings where cars get stolen often, places were homeless congregate, industrial terrains, street names or shady spots in general, but something more specific than a general area (e.g. Molenbeek, Anderlecht).** For the record:\n\n- Yes, I know this is dangerous. I just wish to cycle past and throw a glance. I will call the police in case I spot something.  \n- Yes, I know the van is very likely not in Brussels anymore.  \n- Yes, I should not have left my car in that spot.  \n- Yes, I should have airtagged the van.\n\nRight now I only have the clothes I wear, my backpack, my bike and my network of friends. All my belongings (unfortunately for the thieves almost nothing of real value to them) were in the van. Any advice is welcome. Thank you. Peace.

    "body" : "Hi Early Questions re moving to Brussels:\n\nHi I recently had a trip to Belgium and really loved it there...hard to explain why but people were lovely and had a nice feel to it.\nAnyway im having thoughts of maybe trying something different and leave my hometown Sydney Downunder Australia and try for Bel.\nI can get Irish passport thru ancestry so hopefully that would address any residency barriers per EU? \n\nEarly considerations are:\nA. English and employment: Is it realistic to hope one can find a job as an English only speaker. Im happy to gradually learn Fr or Fl but would not have any baseline language here. Is employment as an English only speaker realistic. \n\nB. More specifically: Employment i have a B.Dent - dental degree from Australia, but it wont be recognised in EU. I have however worked as a clinical lecturer/educator and subject coordinator at a university for 10+yrs. I also have a commerce degree and have project management experience but this is 15+ yrs ago. Wondering (if anyone knows) would it be realistic as an English only speaker to perhaps get a role in Educational development / co ordination/admin and support roles in other corporate, private education, government, tertiary or even healthcare / dental industries or universities. \n\nC. Cost of housing: Areas in Brussels or Antwerp or Ghent for example seem to have relatively low (compared to Sydney) cost of housing. Like 300 to 350k Euro or 1k per mnth for a relatively nice, modern 2br apartment. If this is cost of accommodation then i feel it would be quite financially viable for me relative to Sydney as id draw on savings to assist cover costs whilst looking for employment etc. Are these realistic figures for apartments in; close in / safe / mid range or nicer areas in cities like Brussels or Antwerp or is this more prices for less desirable outlying or unsafe areas. This financial proposition, as in reasonable cost of housing? (Sydney is ridiculous try 2.5k euro equivalent per mnth for an 80sq m, nice but not spectacular 2br, inner city apartment) is a significant factor in my interest and feasibility of moving.\n\nJust early ideas for me now...any other pertinent knowledge or info would be highly appreciated.

We’re here for a week, staying near The Square (Monte des Arts). \n\nWould highly appreciate recommendations for any or all of the following:\n\n1. What we can do today( Saturday) and tomorrow(Sunday). We have an open schedule. Please suggest any nature walks, hiking trails? Is Hallerbos forest a good idea? What else?\n\n2. Coworking spaces or cafes where I can work for a good 5-6 hours in the weekdays? Would be great to network with tech startup founders here.\n\n3. Any community events or founder meetups happening this week?\n\n4. Best things to do in evening during weekdays? Cafes, museums, or any good parks to just chill or bar hopping tours?",

I will be arriving at Midi on Eurostar around 12:30 and heading directly to Brasserie Cantillon (Musée bruxellois de la gueuze).  I was thinking of walking even after seeing people's comments about the station/surrounding area.  I am from NYC and live in Brooklyn, and have decent self-awareness, is walking fine at that time for a 10 minute walk, or should i really just consider an Uber?\n\n2. I booked a hotel that is 1.5 blocks east of the Arts-Loi stop/station, big name company and within my budget.  People suggested staying as close to Grand Place as possible (it's just not in my budget), but saw one hotel for an additional $35usd that's 1 block from the Rogier station/stop.  Both places seem super easy to get back to Midi station the following day for my train, and both seem easy to get to center city.  Is it worth spending more or no, cause i'll just spend that in the city in cafes, bars etc.  \n\nPlaces that I got from the megathread on my list to do: Moeder, Grote Markt, Mennken Pis Statue, Parc du cinquantenaire, Leonidas, Les Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert, Wolf Food Market.  \n\nThank you.",

She and her roommates all developed the same symptoms. It's clear they were bitten by bedbugs.\n\n\n\nWe, the mothers of the roommates, discussed and decided that I would represent the group and write an email to the school expressing our concerns and urging them to ensure that this doesn't happen again. Here's what I wrote:\n\n\n\n\"We strongly urge the school to ensure that such an incident does not happen again. It is crucial that the hygiene conditions of any future accommodation are thoroughly checked and confirmed to be appropriate and safe. The well-being of our children is of utmost importance, and it is distressing to think that this situation could be repeated on future field trips.\"\n\n\n\n I received the following response in June 8th:\n\n\n\n\"I am going to share this information and the photos with our Health Office on Monday and will discuss. We will also contact the hostel and ask some questions. Unfortunately, these things do happen and they happen in some of the best hotels in the world and it is not an issue of cleanliness. But we must do everything we can to ensure our students do not have this experience. If it's from outdoor insects, we can't control it, but I promise to look into it and will get back to you as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n\nNow, I still haven't heard back for 15 days and the school is on vacation. I'm quite frustrated and concerned about the lack of urgency and response. I also believe that the hostel should be obligated to quarantine and take action to address this issue. From what I've read, bedbug infestations can and should be reported to health authorities.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else dealt with a similar situation? What steps should I take next? Any advice on how to ensure the school and hostel take this seriously would be greatly appreciated. No one in my family has ever been bitten by bedbugs before, so I'm unsure how to handle this.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

    "body" : "Hey, \n\nI am a 28 year old man that is looking for classes to learn how to do some soft acrobatics such as kick-up, macaco or front handspring... I always wanted to learn this kind of skills as a kid but I never knew where, and I decided I wanted to starting moving towards learning them before I turn 30.\n\nIt is pretty hard to find classes with this particular focus, even more for adults that are starting. Besides, there are several other classes that do not exclusively focus on this component but include some acrobatics, such as break dance, gymnastics, martial arts or even parkour but they are also usually not for adults at a starting level or they include many other things that are not the acrobatics making wonder if I will ever actually get to learn the acrobatics.\n\nI have been practicing calisthenics in a \"box\" for some months in Lisbon and I love the classes. I like the approach of having progressive exercises because it helps me see progress. I think this is how you build acrobatic moves as well, with progressive exercises that increase in complexity. For that, you usually need someone who knows how to improve, and protect you while you progress and have equipment to make these progressions. I was looking for a place with this kind of equipment and the people with a realistic plan to help me build those skills in Brussels.\n\nIn October, I will move to Brussels and I wanted to join a practice club that includes classes for some acrobatic movements for starting adults. Any suggestions? If you know of any particular coaches that have access to the equipment and would be patient to work with a starter, those recommendations would also be appreciated. 😁\n\nThanks",

Because you're never told why you're rejected there's this question that makes me wonder if I am eligible in the first place. The 42-day rule of having no prior experience in EU \"institutions, organs and bodies\", does it mean that being a trainee at a **Europe Direct Centre or European Documentation Centre** will bar me from getting in? My superiors at both places told me no and that it would actually boost my chances, but I couldn't get official confirmation from the Traineeship Office. Someone on here that claimed to have worked reviewing applications in the past told me he wasn't even sure about it but he believed it wouldn't be a problem. Are there any former EC trainees with prior EDIC or EDC experience here?\n2. **Motivation letter?** Can you please give some **tips on what recruiters like to see?** I think in the past I made a fairly good pitch but maybe recruiters didn't think so...\n3. **Choosing a DG** In the past because of my background - I'm a journalist and work in corporate PR - and interests I chose COMM, CLIMA and Connect, but strategically I wanted to know if there's some informal knowledge about **what DG is easier to get in or even which have good retention rates/open vacancies** —I know landing is never a given but would like to try—.\n4. **UX language**: Finally this is kind of silly but despite setting my preferred language to English the whole UI is in French which makes me wonder if there's some bug that could result in the field showing French to the recruiter despite the answers being in English. If there's anyone who has applied this time and has the same problem let me know.\n\nIf you made it al the way here thank you so much for your time, the **TL;DR really is whether it is possible for me to get the traineeship with previous EDIC and EDC experience** since no one from the EC itself has been able to clarify that.

Up to now, we've been mentioning that we will try find a third person, but my feeling is we'd be better off not mentioning this. Similarly, since my friend is female (and I'm male), the agents often assume we are a couple at first. If an agent never asks about it, and nowhere during the application it asks for the intended household composition, is it fine to not offer this information (ie. that we would intend to take the place for coliving ?)\n\nThe intention after would likely be to sublet to the third person, unless we were sure that asking them to be added to the lease would not pose issues.",

    "body" : "Hello all,\n\nMy boyfriend and I are interested in getting married and then applying for the family reunification visa, but we're concerned about the process and whether it'd actually be approved. My boyfriend is a 19 year old Greek citizen, but he is already a resident in Belgium and has been studying at a Belgian university for the past year and is continuing his studies this year. Recently, he has acquired a part-time job, but mainly lives off his family from Greece's income. I'm an 18 year old American citizen and I'm currently studying in Spain, but I'd like to move to Belgium to be with him. I don't currently have a part-time job, but I'd like to have one once we apply for the family reunification visa. \n\nNow for the questions:\n\n1. What would we need for sufficient means for the family reunification visa? He's mainly supported by his family and savings, would that apply for proof of sufficient means?\n\n2. How recent could the marriage be for the family reunification visa? We're not currently married, but would like to be. We've been dating long-distance for a year and have met each other in person multiple times, once even staying together in a studio apartment for a month.\n\n3. Would it be better to have our marriage in Greece or in Belgium? Does it matter where we get married?\n\n4. Is it necessary that we have the same address? We'd like to live together, but his name is on the lease for a student residence for the school year already and mine can't be added. Would we need to get a new residence with a new lease with both of our names? Otherwise, I would just find residence with a family friend while staying with him often to avoid paying for a new residence.\n\n5. How certain can we be that the family reunification visa would be approved? Is there anything that we can do to increase our chances? If it will be approved, how long would that take?  \n  \nI'm immensely grateful for any help or advice you can provide",

Still, she is first going to take a few lessons at a driving school, cause we don't feel safe without dual controls (seriously, how is that even legal?). Now a Flemish friend told us that supervisors would usually have to take a short course, a so-called vormingsmoment. I never received or found any information about this and I succesfully registered as my girlfriend's supervisor, which initially made me think all steps were completed and we are legally ready to hit the road. Since we heard about this vormingsmoment, I decided to do a Google search on this and all the information I can find only holds in Flanders. We are Dutch, so we have no trouble understanding it, but it mentioned that rules are different in Wallonia and so I suppose in Brussels too. However, we aren't able to find any useful information about the rules in Brussels. So I guess my questions are 1) do I need to take this course and 2) where can I do this?\n\nThanks!",

We take our bikes, becaus my fiancée gets in a lot of pain when she has to walk to far. It helps when even for just half a kilometre we take a bike.The weather won't be great on saturday, but we surely survive a bit of rain.\n\nBeside just Manneken Pis, Grand Place and the classics, what do you think we have to see?\n\n  \nOn Friday, we go to AirOtic Soirée, it starts pretty early, so we plan to get a quick grab beforehand, a pizza or so, what do you recommend, the venue is near the Palace of Justice. On Saturday, we want to have a nice, romantic dinner.\n\n  \nSo, what do you recommend, for during the day, outside or inside, and for dinner? Of course I'm doing my own research, but I know the people who live in a city, know the best places! We don't mind missing a traditional \"must see\" and instead \"waste\" a few hours in a less traditional place that gives us stories and memories! For example, last year we went to Mechelen and spent more than an hour in a bookstore.\n\n  \nWe've had a couple of rough years, and are going to a really rough period now (not relational, but other factors).

Most likely.\n\nThis Catch-22 is why so many people who are desperate send money every which way and make reckless decisions. Scummy landlords realize this and are only too happy to take advantage to \"hold on to your money\". \n\nThe most efficient way to do this is to get here a week early, stay in an AirBNB (yes, this costs money), and provide a copy of the lease to the commune at the registration appointment. Landlords only need proof of deposit, you can do this after you move in. This way you get your Belgian ID number on the spot (it's printed on the Annex they give you). Double-check what commune they'll be living in and see about making an appointment already.\n\nBanks don't need the physical card, they just need the Belgian ID number (yyyy.mm.dd-xxx.xx) and at worst, a passport. \n\nFYI that since COVID, most banks work by appointment only, and if you just want to open an account, they'll keep sending you to do it online unless you insist.",

Around UCL Alma, there are plenty of residential areas. Look in Woluwe-St-Lambert, Woluwe-St-Pierre, near Roodebeek metro, the Stockel area, etc. \n\n2) Go to Facebook and find groups where people rent in Brussels. For September you are already fairly late, so start replying to advertisements ASAP and organise some visits.\n\nYou are a **prime target** for shitty landlords who want to take advantage of you. There is a correct and an incorrect way of finding a room, and they are hoping that you are desperate enough to pretty much do anything, including sending money. **Do not send money over the internet unless you have physically been inside the room, in person.**\n\n3) Arrive in Brussels a week or two before your Erasmus starts. Stay in an AirBNB if you can. Aim for multiple visits per day - two in the morning, lunch break, two in the afternoon, dinner, and maybe one at night. Do not be afraid to call the landlord directly (no SMS). Go to your visits, see if you like the place, and if you like it, *take it*. Don't hesitate. \n\nIt takes a few days to send your lease contract etc., so this is why I *strongly* recommend that you arrive *early* for your Erasmus. Make SURE that you read the contract carefully, and that it says that you will leave as of DD/MM/YYYY - so that the landlord already knows FAR ahead of time.\n\nEnjoy your stay.",

    "body" : "Hi,\n\nIt's a bit of a tricky question and requires some explaining.\n\nMost international people end up living in what's called the \"Bubble\". It's the community of people who end up working for the EU, or one of the various consulting companies/NGO's whose existence relies almost exclusively on the EU. The language in this community, 9 times out of 10, is English. \n\nHowever, there's a trend among these folks. They generally stick together, go to the same bars, live in the same area, and seldom get involved in local life (which does NOT happen in English). There's not much effort to learn French/Dutch, and there's an extremely high turnover too - plenty of folks come for a year or two, then leave. If you stick to this community of people, you should be just fine with English, but you'll have a rotating cast of friends that switches every so often.\n\nIf you intend on staying in Brussels long-term (over 5 years), then it's truly very helpful to learn the majority language, which is French. \n\nTo be clear, Brussels is *not* a city like Amsterdam or Stockholm where 100% of people will immediately switch to English. You will be served in English in very specific parts of the city (namely the tourist areas and the European Quarter) and most people under 40 can help you out, but this is *not* a guarantee that everybody here speaks English. In fact, in certain administrative situations, people aren't *allowed* to help you in English.\n\nIf you're not sure, learn some survival French. Hello, goodbye, how much is this, where's the bathroom, etc. \n\nGood luck!",

You're right. The bus price is not reduced, it's just the train ticket.   \nSo, the total with regular combo ticket is €17.40.\n\nIf you take the youth ticket for the train separately, it would be cheaper overall (7.50 + 6 = 13.50). \n\nAnother quicker (but slightly more expensive, €19.50) alternative is the [Flibco](https://www.flibco.com/en) shuttle bus which takes around 55 mins from Charleroi Airport to Brussels Midi. The TEC bus + SNCB train would take around 90 mins or so.",
