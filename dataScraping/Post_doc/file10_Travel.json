The time is dependent on how fast you get through the wickets (ie get your interview scheduled) and what all pops up on your background check.\n\nETA: it’s good for 5 years, so even f it doesn’t make it by your next trip, it’ll be there for your second."

Schedule and attend an interview.\n3. Wait for and receive approval.\n\nSeems people are focused on Steps 2 and 3, but when people speak about a long time to approval, they’re typically referring to long times until *conditional approval* (Step 1). Step 3 is done within hours, and Step 2 can be accelerated if you’re flexible enough, e.g. going to other locations, frequently checking for cancellations, or just doing the interview upon return from an international trip. But Step 1 is completely beyond your control.\n\nAs you can see, many people are approved pretty quickly, within a week, but there are others who have to wait months for conditional approval. And, unfortunately, it’s impossible to predict which batch you’re in.\n\nIf you traveling internationally with some degree of frequency, I’d just apply for GE and wait however long it takes. Perhaps you’ll be lucky and have it done quickly and problem solved. At least it’s a one-time wait."

Obviously you can’t schedule an interview until after you’ve received conditional approval, but your repeated statement that the issue is about “getting the in person interview timely” suggests that the issue is the period between conditional approval and an opportunity for an interview, i.e. scheduling an interview. That can take time, sure, but this can be shortened substantially depending on the applicant’s flexibility and eagerness. If that was the only issue, we’d get far fewer people concerned about GE times.\n\nThe concern people have is in regards to the time between application and conditional approval, which is completely out of the applicants’ control, and is what most people mean when they say it takes a long time to be approved. Given your experience of how quickly you received conditional approval, you may not realize how big of an issue that part can be."
