I have come to realize that Adult friendship is tough everywhere and not just in Luxembourg.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing for hobbies, that is the easiest way to make friends anywhere. You like to read join a book club, you like to cycle join a cycling club etc \n\nAlso, if you are a Christian, the church is a good place as well to meet people and make friends. \n\nI like great discussions too. Happy to be messaged , if  you want to hang out and discuss diverse topics over coffee or tea.",
