Saw the guy, moved my bag, walked off, other the course of multiple times back and forth.  \nIn hindsight, it was a friday eveneing, I was tired from the workweek. Took the train because I didn't want to drive myself. And was chilling, watching some Netflix.  \nI had a false sense of security. I had that feeling when boarding a plane, once you are seated and the doors are closed you wait until arrival.\n\nIt was an expensive lesson, ever since I lock my luggage to the overhead with a small chain and lock when traveling by international train.",
