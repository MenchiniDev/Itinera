The offender was a young lad who's car was packed to the brim, casually eating sweets as he told me this stuff happened to him all of the time.\n\nAfter the initial assessment and waiting for the car to be towed an officer approached me and said he could smell weed and that I had to do a drugs test for it. I was in shock at the time and complied, despite clearly not smelling of weed or showing any signs of being innebreiated. \n\nHe held me in the police car for 45 minutes waiting for the test to come up positive. Just kept turning back to look at me then the test. When it was pretty obvious that I was sober he was clearly disappointed and frustrated, then told me that I was lucky it was clear \"You would have been locked up\". \n\nLike, fuck off mate? I'm sober and just had my car written off? Lost any remaining respect for the police about then",

Bail out with extendables fully erect and ready go, and are eyeballing me like like the last turkey at christmas. Drag me out, acting like Im driving the parked, broken, not on engine and ready to boot it away. \n\nSo, I explain the details. I further explain that they should already know this, since they responded the night before and took a detailed report. Had caught in the cunts in the act, and was really a big deal only 8 hours earlier. So there I am, standing outside my house and the prick says \"Where do you live?\". So I point and say \"there.\". Prick gets right in my grill and starts calling me all the cheeky little cunts under the sun. A bit of back and worth, because I wont fucking stand being spoken to like that, and he finally asks the question that he meant to in the first place. \"What is your address?\".\n\nAt no point in the interaction was there any attempts on their part to de-escalate. It was ramped up at every turn in an effort to make me cower to them. And that was my crime too. That I dared to look at them when they jumped out their car brandishing weapons, in plain clothes, in broad daylight. Apparently I should have been too scared to look or something. \n\nLost all respect for cops right then and its never come back. Ill be civil, but thats it.

Because some police are hideous human beings? \n\nCan you please quote me where I have said anything remotely like this? \n\nI was simply pointing out that the government's own site admits that only 1 in 28 referrals are investigated so any stats about police misconduct will be undervalued due to this.\n\nYou have completely made up your own argument here .",

    "body" : "Yes, very true. I believe the original idea behind the slogan was that some funding should be pulled from the police and distributed to community based organisations. This came about because of the issue of police with guns turning up to situations such as mental health cases, which escalated the problems, sadly resulting in some incidents of unnecessary deaths. These issues were more likely to occur in communities of colour where the police were not as diverse as the community they represented exacerbating cultural misunderstandings. The original idea, as I understand it, was that if the money spent on the police dealing with those issues was just given to the community in the first place, then there would be less issues and less people hurt. The political right took advantage of the slogan and turned it into these crazy leftists want to get rid of the police altogether.",

It's about investing in other social institutions and not relying only on policing for social issues. \n\nI hope that clears up the confusion for you.",

There are good and bad police officers, like there are good and bad doctors, or any other group. The good ones still have families who fear for their lives on a regular basis. This rhetoric we are slipping into of ‘all police officers are terrible’ is not helpful. If I were a good police officer (I’m not one at all, FYI), it must be really demoralising to be on the receiving end of this constantly when you know you’re doing a good job. I can’t for the life of me fathom why anyone would want to do it as a career, and given one of the other major issues they face is lack of resources, this rhetoric isn’t exactly going to encourage people who can help to make a difference to join.",
