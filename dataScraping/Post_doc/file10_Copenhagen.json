Its a very specific business, and its hard to guess. \n\nAlso I don't think you need to be on a good shoppingstreet, you cater to a specific clientele, they will come find you as long as you pop up on Google maps and do some advertising, especially if you do a niche. \n\nHave you thought about starting on one of the many loppemarked to get a feel of the market."

You might be able to get a short term lease at a reduced price. That's what an acquaintance did for a pop-up."

N√∏rrebro is a good spot for some kinds of vintage, Frederiksberg and Vesterbro for other kinds. Usually, it‚Äôs a specific street. Selling expensive art? Go for Store Kongensgade."

For many well off individuals where only one is working, it is cheaper to run a business that takes a yearly loss rather than letting the non-working partner do ‚Äústay at home‚Äù which often entails wasted money on large personal purchases. Spoke with a couple of contractors doing work for people in the northern suburbs of Copenhagen and they experienced it too. Fascinating really."
