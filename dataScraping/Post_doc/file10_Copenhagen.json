Its a very specific business, and its hard to guess. \n\nAlso I don't think you need to be on a good shoppingstreet, you cater to a specific clientele, they will come find you as long as you pop up on Google maps and do some advertising, especially if you do a niche. \n\nHave you thought about starting on one of the many loppemarked to get a feel of the market.",

You might be able to get a short term lease at a reduced price. That's what an acquaintance did for a pop-up.",
