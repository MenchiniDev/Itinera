How would they know if it was brand new? I would just really carefully check your other belongings to do the best you can to avoid them having to open your case (eg I got searched recently because my toothpaste tube was too big 😞).\n\nETA: loads of people travel with engagement rings for planned proposals, I assume they just stick them in their bag and call it good??",

Since both of our friends were traveling the world, it was a nice idea to reunite at the world's end (from our point of living).\nMy friend had the idea to propose, so he ordered the ring online and sent it to my place, and asked me to bring it to new zealand. When we entered, I headed to customs and they asked for the rings origin and if I planned to take it back with me. Since that was my intention (cause my friends soon-to-be-fiance would keep it), they told me, I would have to pay taxes.\nI told them the hole story and the both custom lady's were visibly delighted...and let me go.\n\nI wasn't even thinking a second about just wearing that damned ring and wear it \"as my own\", which would have been way smarter.",
