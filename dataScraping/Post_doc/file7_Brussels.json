Hip streets of today were fairly empty, St-Gery, Rue Dansaert. \n\n\nYou can see them here which include many pictures of the previous link (https://www.flickr.com/photos/52086447@N00/sets/72157638982316363/)\n\n\nBrusselisation, mass unemployment, violent attacks of the CCC, frequent murders... Bruzz wrote a few times about this period (https://www.bruzz.be/dossier/de-grauwe-jaren-1980).\n\n\nThere are different problems the city has nowadays, but it has improved compared to those times"

Too much immigration, which completely changed the character of Molenbeek, Schaerbeek, Sint Joos and other parts of the city. People were protesting about it then and being called racist and marginalised. Today, even the migrant middle class does not want to live in many of these areas, by my reckoning more than half of Brussels. How can you say it’s better today, when Brussels has been effectively ghettoised and rendered ungovernable? Sure , the gentrified and trendy bits and pieces of Brussels are “better”….!"
