Make an inventory of atuff that was stolen, this you need for police report and insurance. \nReplace the apartment lock with anti theft locks, get security equipments like RING or Verisure to prevent such a thing from happening again.\nMake a police report. \nIf you have insurance, contact them with the police report \nMake peace with the fact that you will never get back the stolen stuff, you can earn them back. But its important to feel safe again in the apartment so make sure to get those security measures.",
