Cafe Richard is in the immediate vicinity of the Dom and you could start there with a nice breakfast. The Dom itself is open early so you can check that out before or after breakfast. Most other museums open around 10. If your hotel is a bit more out of the way, drop your luggage at the main station, it's also immediately by the Dom.",
