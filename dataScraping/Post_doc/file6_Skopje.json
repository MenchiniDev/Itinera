    "Body" : "Ideally I'd stay away from the center.\nLook into the neighborhoods of KapiÅ¡tec or Debar Maalo, they are both quite close but away from the main congestion points that can get noisy.\n\nThe \"old\" (as in, Yugoslav old) parts of the city are built so that there are large buildings along Boulevards to decrease noise pollution behind them, softening the noise. I am, however, not aware of any hotels in these blocks as they are residence only. You might be able to find an airbnb there tho.\n\nRule of thumb : avoid Rekord, and anything right on the sidewalk of the Boulevards going west-east (there are three of them). And the old bazaar, things get cramped there often."
