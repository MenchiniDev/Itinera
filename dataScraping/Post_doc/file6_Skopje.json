I am, however, not aware of any hotels in these blocks as they are residence only. You might be able to find an airbnb there tho.\n\nRule of thumb : avoid Rekord, and anything right on the sidewalk of the Boulevards going west-east (there are three of them). And the old bazaar, things get cramped there often.",
