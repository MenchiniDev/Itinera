I have an aunt here in Belgium who has been here for 20 years, complains that her welfare isn‚Äôt high enough, worked a total of 2 years, learned some Dutch but that‚Äôs it. When I think of how much taxes I pay on my salary to fund lazy asses like my aunt I loose all respect for the Belgian state.

    "Body" : "I think there is a basic confusion in the discussion between economic migrants and refugees. \n\n‚ÄúRefugee‚Äù is a temporary status under international law. You are a refugee because it is currently unsafe for you to stay in the place you were living in, so you benefit from international protection in a state that grants it. Once it‚Äôs deemed safe for you to go back to your country of origin, you are normally expected to do so (and in some countries, you actually must do so).\n\nAn economic migrant is a person that chooses to move countries in order to better their economic situation - depending on migration rules, a migrant may never be necessarily expected to go back. \n\nThis difference informs the different ways access to employment is handled for these different groups. In some countries, refugees don‚Äôt even have a right to work - because governments want to make sure they don‚Äôt develop strong ties with the country, don‚Äôt settle down and actually go back to their place of origin. In some countries you need a job offer before you even move to the host country as an economic migrant. Refugees have limited access to the job market, sometimes they can‚Äôt access employment before a given time frame, and their status is continuously tied to renewal, usually forever. \n\nNow, does this change the fact that your Ukrainian flatmate may be a lazy manchild? No. Refugees are people and you don‚Äôt need to be a good person to be a refugee. The support we provide to refugees is an act of solidarity we are offering to a person who is in danger. The support to economic migrant (ie social security, unemployment benefits) is support that is provided to workers. \n\nThis does not change the fact the people abuse the system, or that we should do better to integrate refugees and asylum seekers in our society, job market etc‚Ä¶ But refugees are not expected necessarily to work under international law cause that‚Äôs not what the status of refugee is about."

    "Body" : "The thing is: is you have a good system for supporting refugees (example: immediatly a house, money to live from, immediatly a somewhat job) what do you think the result will be?\n\nExactly: more and more refugees. Why? Because they immediatly get a house, get money to live from, immediatly get a somewhat job. That is the field of tention in creating a systeem for the support of refugees. Too good a systeem will eventually be its own downfall. Too bad of a systeem and you see what is happening now. \n\nBut the problem is that we just cannot handle all the refugees and immigrants here in Europe. Imagine that close to Monte Mattina in Italy we would create a camp with tents of say 16km2. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jan/27/why-ikea-flatpack-refugee-shelter-won-design-of-the-year](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jan/27/why-ikea-flatpack-refugee-shelter-won-design-of-the-year)\n\nBig fence around it. Have shared toilets. Showers. Create shifts for cleaning. Create field kitchens so everybody has shifts there too (in other words: keep them busy). Few doctors. Couple of police officers. But do not let them out. Because if you let them out unsupervised that is when the shit begins. Look at Brussels. On  big open tent camp. Want to see one? Just go to Congres trainstation in the Pachecolaan. I can still remember they were sleeping in the entrence of Gallery 44. The smell of shit and urine if you walked over there was terrible. \n\nI have and will always plead for deals with Tunesia and Libya to set up camps over there for at least the refugees/immegrants from Africa to create a safe haven. But it must also be very clear to them that Europe is not for them. Like the Australians say to immigrants: Australia will not be your home. Exactly that we have to make clear to Africans: Europe will not be your home. We just cannot take the whole burden of the world on the shoulders of Europe. \n\nSecond, just go around North Station at night. We just have to start with an active resettlement program, meaning deporting people back to Africa. I am certain that nobody really know how many people actually live in Brussels. In The Netherlands everybody has to be registered. No registration? No right to anything including. You will not even be able to get a bankaccount because you have to show prove of residency. The local municipalities have to know exactly where you live. And even in The Netherlands there are illegals. But Brussels, Brussels really has turned it into a big shitshow. Or rather, Belgium.\n\nFailed support and assistance of refugees? No, rather the failed idea of open borders and the idea of mrs. Merkel \"we can do it\". We cannot do it. We simply have to say enough is enough and close for everybody and get our shit in order. And perhaps in 10 years from now,  if we really start to clean up by expelling people, we can perhaps allow people back in."

At the CPAS they are required to tell you that, and to have you sign a paper acknowledging that you got this information, and depending on who receives you you will get different phrasing of this. When I was at CPAS (it lasted 18 months) as an eu national one Belgium for less than 3 years (together with my girlfriend in the same situation), the first person who welcomed at the CPAS told us that we **would**  get deported if we asked for it.\n\nThen we did ask for it, and when I met the counsellor in charge of my file, we discussed this, and he told me in 5 years working there it happened only once to someone he was in charge of. And that in my case it would probably never happen. \n\nAnd indeed, it never happened. \n\nI think it's all down to how temporary they evaluate your situation to be, and it's all to the discretion of the office des √©trangers.
