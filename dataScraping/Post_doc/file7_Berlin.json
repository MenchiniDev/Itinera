Von ihm ist kein konstruktiver Beitrag zur Befriedung gesellschaftlicher Konflikte zu erwarten. Nicht erst seit dem 7. Oktober steht der Verein an der Seite antisemitischer Aufrührer in Deutschland und beteiligt sich an ihren Demonstrationen.“\n\n>**Petra Pau, MdB (Die Linke), Vizepräsidentin des Deutschen Bundestags**: „Die aktuellen Aktivitäten der ‚**Jüdischen Stimme‘ haben ein neues Niveau der Holocaustrelativierung** erreicht. Mit ihrem Demoaufruf zum Holocaustgedenktag am 27.01.2024 unter dem Motto ‚Nie wieder ist jetzt – Nie wieder für alle‘ betreibt sie gefährliche Geschichtsklitterung. Die Gruppierung versucht nicht nur die Gedenktage selbst neu zu besetzen, sondern versucht Begriffe des Gedenkens an NS-Opfer gezielt zu kapern und an ihre Stelle antisemitische Propaganda zu stellen.“\n\n>**Tahera Ameer, Programmvorstand der Amadeu Antonio Stiftung**: „‚Jüdische Stimme für gerechten Frieden in Nahost‘, das klingt nach Ausgleich und Versöhnung. Doch was gut klingt, täuscht: Auf ihren Demonstrationen, aber vor allem auch via Social Media wird immer wieder israelbezogener Antisemitismus verbreitet. Die ‚Jüdische Stimme‘ versammelt jüdische, anti-israelische Positionen und arbeitet mit Akteuren aus dem BDS-Spektrum zusammen. Aufgrund ihrer Sprecherposition hat **sie im antisemitischen Diskurs eine wichtige Entlastungsfunktion und dient damit gut als Rechtfertigung für die Verbreitung von israelbezogenem und Post-Shoah-Antisemitismus**. So können sich andere auf sie als jüdische Gruppe berufen und damit versuchen, sich gegen den Antisemitismus-Vorwurf zu immunisieren – der hierzulande ja gemeinhin als schlimmer gilt als der Antisemitismus selbst.“\n\n[https://iibsa.org/neuerscheinung-zur-juedischen-stimme-fuer-gerechten-frieden/](https://iibsa.org/neuerscheinung-zur-juedischen-stimme-fuer-gerechten-frieden/)\n\n**Which is also not conducive to combating antisemitism: by calling for a demonstration with the name ‘glory to the resistance’ on the anniversary of the massacre of 7.10.23:**\n\n**SOURCE FOR MOD:** [**https://taz.de/Protest-am-Jahrestag-des-7-Oktober-2023/!6041654/**](https://taz.de/Protest-am-Jahrestag-des-7-Oktober-2023/!6041654/)\n\n>Beworben wurde die Demo, die am ersten Jahrestag der [Hamas-Massaker in Israel](https://taz.de/7-Oktober--ein-Jahr-danach/!6034827/) stattfand, unter dem Motto: „Glory to the resistance“, zu Deutsch: „Ruhm dem Widerstand“.\n\n>Zur Demonstration aufgerufen hatten unter anderem die trotzkistische Gruppe „Arbeiterinnenmacht“ sowie die „Kommunistische Organisation“, „Alliance of Internationalist Feminists“, „Palästina Spricht“ und die „Jüdische Stimme für einen gerechten Frieden in Nahost“."

Citing JVP as a source for anything related to us, is absolute BS. They are such a fringe group within our community. They have many times openly supported antisemitic terrorists, have tried to rewrite history and even ancient Jewish holidays to fit in their anti-Zionist agenda and do not offer a nuanced viewpoint of the war or the situation of Jews in Berlin/worldwide. Taking them as a representative of jews is like saying Reichsbürger views are representative of the German people. \n\nAlso, in the rules it is mentioned, that there has been progress in terms of antisemitism in the recent years. As a person deeply affected I disagree and so do police reports as well as independent sources such as RIAS. The sentence, that our Jewish ancestors were „forced out“ is a hardcore euphemism for mass murdered and exterminated. Also insinuating that Israel’s actions derail the fight against antisemitism is a false argument \n\nAlso, citing the Hamas run Gaza health ministry as a credible source is definitely a bold choice. \n\nAll in all, I think talking to - instead of about - actual Jewish people about this issue, could have resolved a lot these issues"

And they think like Eastern European boomers do - swinging Conservative, maybe a bit more mid-left/sociallib than other boomers. Surely not JVP or far-left.\n\n*Some* Jewish communities in *some* cities (Berlin, Hamburg mostly) might be the one exception, actually, because they are the only places with somewhat significant migration of young Jews from the Anglosphere. Still far from the norm.\n\nEven if one rejects the IHRA definition: There are alternatives  out there, no need for JVP\n\nActually using a fringe group like JVP there makes me doubt the good intentions of the mods (Edit: I am also not surprised that the mod posting these rules is a rStaiy user.

The same way that it’s unfair and reductionist to assume that any Shia Muslim = the Iranian regime or that any Italian = the Catholic Church etc. \n\nAnd before any smart ass tries weighing in with some dumb shit, no I absolutely do not condone what Hamas did. \n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a terrorist group committing an atrocity is an excuse to punish an entire population because it absolutely isn’t. But that’s what ended up happening and that’s the stance the German government supports. It supports punishing the downtrodden people of Gaza because of the actions of some assholes holding them hostage. \n\nThe last time there was an “election” in Gaza was nearly 2 decades ago so don’t try and argue that the people in Gaza (mostly minors who weren’t even born then) chose this. \n\nI’ll end this by saying that of the 2 sides in this conflict one is a terrorist organization and the other is a country claiming to be “the most moral” on the planet. \n\nSo who do you think has the greater burden of responsibility to behave properly and do what’s right? Because whenever I hear an argument like yours it sounds like you’re saying Israel has the right to behave like a terrorist organization just because they were attacked by one."

In that vein, experts note that Israel’s “coercive measures” have further “[impeded efforts to build proper democratic institutions](https://international-review.icrc.org/sites/default/files/irrc-888-maurer.pdf),” and that Israel still has [not transferred](https://www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/Report%20for%20the%20website.pdf) sovereign powers and instead maintains control over “the \\[Palestinian Authority\\]’s ability to function effectively.” Based on the actual exercise of effective control, they, therefore, find that Israel has occupied Gaza since the broader occupation of Palestine [began](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/06/israel-occupation-50-years-of-dispossession/) in 1967.\""

The post talks about how there weren't any hunts on Jews and how the violence was incited by Mossad agents who travelled with the Maccabi fans. \n\n-  They frequently endorse or even host convicted terrorists like Leila Khaled (took part in plane hijackings), Marwan Barghouti (serving time for multiple counts of murder) and even Ahmad Sa’adat who's in prison for assassinating an Israeli minister. I'm pretty sure they had Rasmea Odeah at one of their conferences as well, just to top it off. \n\nSo yeah, there's quite a bit of mental gymnastics involved to explain why an organisation that claims to represent the *entire* Jewish community keeps associating with people who actively want to harm it. \n\nOh actually my favourite tid bit of info on JVP is how they, to this day, keep sharing drawings by [Carlos Latuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Latuff) on their social media channels. \n\n> In December 2006, Latuff gained the joint-second prize [...] at the Iranian International Holocaust Cartoon Competition."

    "Body" : "I’m Jewish and live in Berlin. In one of my German language classes here in Berlin, I met another Jew from Jewish Voices for Peace who defended Hamas as not oppressive. What an awful viewpoint. I condemn Hamas and the atrocities they routinely commit against both Palestinian and Israeli civilians, and therefore I condemn Jewish Voices for Peace as long as they refuse to condemn Hamas.\n\nBut the IHRA definition also has real severe problems from the other direction. It has been weaponized by defenders of the actions of Netanyahu and his right-wing allies to shun and silence Jewish critics of the current Israeli government’s atrocities in Gaza, like myself and pretty much every other Jew I know in my daily life outside of online arguments, and possibly also outside of the religiously observant part of my extended family (I’m secular myself). None of us would defend Hamas like Jewish Voices for Peace seems to, but the awful atrocities committed by Hamas don’t automatically justify the far greater level of atrocities which Israel has committed against Gaza in response. Even if my personal social and family circles don’t numerically reflect the plurality or majority viewpoint of all Jews on Israel/Palestine matters, our positions are far more common among Jews than what can be called fringe, unlike JVP Jews and other Hamas defenders who are absolutely fringe.\n\nJust because the IHRA definition has a lot of institutional support does not make it neutral, it just makes it politically de rigeur among governments and organizations that want to show their support for the Israeli political establishment and its allies. It’s as close to the opposite extreme from JVP as the Israeli establishment and their allies can get away with promoting to the worldwide political community.\n\nSo, I support your opposition to listing Jewish Voices for Peace in this sub’s guidance, unless the person I met was somehow much more extreme than the group’s standard viewpoints (I doubt it). But please don’t put the IHRA definition in their place."

It's really hard for people to learn about antisemitism and how to oppose it if you expect them accept a system of oppression against people like them. JVP can be effective here, because they don't ask for that, they simply ask for people not discriminate against other members of minority religions, something Muslims in the west can identify with."

Data from 2004-2021 on direct conflict deaths from the Small Arms Survey, estimates that the highest number of women killed in a single year was over 2,600 in Iraq in 2016.\n\nThe record number of women and children killed in Gaza does not include those among nearly 20,000 people who are either unidentified, missing or entombed beneath rubble. Earlier this year, a study published in The Lancet estimated the true number of deaths in Gaza could be over 186,000, taking indirect deaths – for example, due to starvation and lack of health care – into consideration. \"\n\n[https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/more-women-and-children-killed-gaza-israeli-military-any-other-recent-conflict](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/more-women-and-children-killed-gaza-israeli-military-any-other-recent-conflict)\n\nAnd now you also have to consider, that not every man killed in Gaza is a Hamas combatant and you can easily reach a probable civilian casualty rate of over 50% from the direct bombings combat ALONE. But I guess thats an acceptable figure for you, which would leave me with no words if you dont have the compassion to see that this isnt right.\n\nAlso first you claimed there has been no oppression in Gaza by the Israeli State, now you moved the goalpost too \"Its all justified\". Maybe the ongoing rightlessness and oppression of the palestinian people causes these attacks on the Israeli population too? If you constantly treat people like animals, theyre gonna become aggressive and hopeless. If Israel wants long term peace and security, they MUST find a way to give palestinians peace too. \n\nMaybe the 2 State solutions could have worked in the past but Israel has done its best to destroy any probability of it happening thanks to the ongoing colonization and settlement expansion of the West Bank."

    "Body" : "The core IHRA definition itself is inherently flawed, because it is vague and ambiguous enough to be quite honestly interpreted in harmful ways that support censorship of legitimate and non-bigoted criticism of the Israeli government's actions or of Zionism as a whole. Some of the examples accompanying it, all of which IHRA proponents usually insist on unconditionally adopting in full, are also quite problematic.\n\nAlthough it is possible to interpret the IHRA definition in reasonable ways, the problem is that one does not actually have to be dishonest to interpret it in ways which naturally lead to harmful censorship.\n\nTo those who say criticism of Zionism is automatically anti-Semitic: some of the most blindly pro-Israel advocacy groups, like the Anti-Defamation League, do equate anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism. That's only a legitimate conclusion when you start with a sufficiently extreme definition of anti-Zionism, as they do. I will agree with them, and probably with everyone here, that wanting to wipe Israel off the face of the earth due to hatred of Jews is absolutely anti-Semitic, and wanting to wipe Israel off the face of the earth for other reasons is still awful and worth condemning even if I'd put that outside the definition of anti-Semitism.\n\nMy view is much more moderate than that. Israel should continue to exist as a country without any massive destruction or displacement of individuals, because no matter what was done right or wrong in the 1940s when it was created, it has now existed for 76 years, and any population of even that longevity deserves its future. But equally, the Gazan civilian population (I don't mean Hamas fighters here) also deserves a far more robust future far better than the Israeli government and IDF are permitting, the many Palestinian families which were displaced when Israel was created deserve at a minimum an official acknowledgement by Israel of the harm that was done to them, it should be recognized that the attempts to keep Israel a \"Jewish and democratic state\" are demographically destined to fail as long as the net growth in the non-Jewish population of Israel is larger than the net growth of its Jewish population, and the Israeli establishment should categorically rule out the use of war crimes like forcible mass displacement in any attempts to change that demographic destiny.\n\nThat should not be classified as an anti-Semitic view, even if it's very much non-Zionist. To the extent that there's a difference between non-Zionism and anti-Zionism, I would say that I'm anti-Zionist in the sense that I wish the world had not been so anti-Semitic as to leave 1940s European Jewry with no other safe option at the time but to create Israel. My preference would have been to give them either citizenship in or their own country carved out from one of the adequately fertile parts of the world with lots of relatively unpopulated space available for them, such as certain regions of the US. But I realize that too many countries were indeed too anti-Semitic back then for any other option to occur.\n\nMy hope is that neither Israel's Jewish population nor its non-Jewish population is subject to forced displacement, expulsion, destruction of life or property, or legal restrictions on how many kids they're allowed to have - and the same for the civilians in the Palestinian occupied territories, with the possible exception of those Jewish settlers from Israel who arrived there as knowing participants in an intentional effort to shift the demographic reality on the ground to the detriment of the Palestinian population that was already living there under Israeli occupation. Of course, even for the Jewish settlers knowingly participating in that awful project, I wouldn't want them to be wiped off the face of the earth or suffer any other violent consequences, just at the most forced to return to Israel with any further punishment to be determined through some appropriate judicial proceeding based on their level of personal culpability.\n\nSo, effectively, I think Israel needs to do better at acknowledging and respecting the Palestinians, and at properly handling its role as an occupying power. I find it awful Israel that views the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure and the repeated displacement of its civilian population as an appropriate and proportionate response to Hamas's atrocities on and before October 7 of last year. Israel shouldn't be competing with Hamas to see who can harm Gaza more. But, in effect if not in intent, they very much are.\n\nSince Israel often claims to act for all Jews and proudly label themselves as \"the Jewish state\", their self-framing makes it natural for their victims and those who care about them to incorrectly infer that Israel's actions against them are in fact those of the whole Jewish community. I agree with Israel that it's anti-Semitic to blame all Jews for the actions of Israel (or of any other subset of the Jewish community), but that's exactly why it's so harmful for Israel to frequently communicate and label itself in ways which directly invite this inference. Israel's conscious and explicit linkage of itself with the global Jewish community directly promotes anti-Semitism when Israel acts in such awful ways."

    "Body" : "> If you have the capacity, I'd appreciate hearing your breakdown of a specific IHRA example and why it's problematic.\n\nI've already spent too much time on Reddit today to do that, but I did a quick search online for other breakdowns, and here's one of the first that came up regarding the IHRA example claiming that it's anti-Semitic to call the existence of the State of Israel a racist endeavour\":\n\nhttps://www.noihra.ca/11-examples\n\nI think it's fair to say the Palestinians (and Mizrahi Jews) suffered due to racism in connection with the establishment of the State of Israel, even if much of the reason behind that establishment was protecting Jews from anti-Semitism/racism in Europe. Admitting that truth isn't anti-Semitic.\n\nThe group behind that page, Independent Jewish Voices Canada, appears not to be anywhere near the same kind of fringe as Jewish Voices for Peace. The main controversies reflected on their Wikipedia page are not about their viewpoints or positions. Wikipedia simply documents them once not carefully vetting what website they were linking to, and once not carefully vetting the unrelated past statements (not about Israel or Jewish issues) of one of their co-coordinators who stepped down after the controversy broke.\n\n> One question this part of your comment: \"wanting to wipe Israel off the face of the earth for other reasons is still awful and worth condemning even if I'd put that outside the definition of anti-Semitism\". Why does intent prevail over impact on your definition of antisemitism? My antiracism education has led me to believe that impact alone can identify racist positions and actions. This has the added benefit of decreasing defensiveness: anyone is capable of propagating racism; it doesn't indicate that you're a fundamentally bad person.\n\nI agree with you about racism, for what it's worth.\n\nI was just making a definitional distinction, but I was not viewing any reason for wanting Israel wiped off the face of the earth as acceptable. Things that are not anti-Semitism can be just as bad and just as worthy of condemnation as things that are.\n\nAnti-Semitism isn't meant to reflect all awful or bigoted things that are worth condemning any more than anti-racism is, even when the target is Israel. It's specifically meant to be about hatred of Jews as Jews. Or, to your point, at least about prejudice against Jews as Jews, if the word \"hatred\" suggests intent more than I meant. I consider anti-Semitism to be the same concept as racism directed at Jews, except sidestepping the complicated question of whether Jews are a race/ethnicity or a religion.\n\nSo, for example, yeah, someone who wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth because they've been fed a lifetime of lies and have been genuinely led to believe that any majority-Jewish country is inherently an existential threat to them would be acting out of anti-Semitism, even if they don't experience a feeling they would label as hatred.\n\nBut someone who wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth because their ancestors were displaced from that very same land and they want to kick out the invader country might not be acting out of anti-Semitism, even if mass-displacing or mass-destroying the modern population of Israel would be an awful war crime regardless of motivation."

Because every single organisation, however big or small, however famous or unknown, that publishes anything vaguely critical of Israel's actions is immediately smeared and discredited. No amount of fealty or conditional language is ever enough.  \n  \nThe BBC is Hamas, the NYT is Hamas, the Washington Post is Hamas, the UN is Hamas, Oxfam is Hamas, MSF is Hamas, Amnesty is Hamas, Haaretz is Hamas, The Guardian is Hamas, the ICJ is Hamas, South Africa is Hamas, Spain is Hamas, Ireland is Hamas, Wagenknecht is Hamas, Baerbock is Hamas, university presidents and deans are Hamas, some school or kita is Hamas, certain jewish people who disagree with me are Hamas... nobody passes the test."

    "Body" : "Lol, Oxfans business is to “bring aid” and it survives on donations - sure they don’t over extend the truth to get more donations and what not. Super reliable! \n\n\nFrom The Lancet: \n\nThe journal publishes original **research articles, review articles (“seminars” and “reviews”), editorials, book reviews, correspondence, as well as news features and case reports.** \n\n\nAnd what is a medical journal doing reporting on war? How focused are they in reporting **who** caused that child to become an amputee? -as you put? \n-or is it the case that they are reporting in a health situation of a location but nothing about says “this bullet, or better saying ~this drone~ who hit this child’s leg left its signature and *yes, it was an Israeli one*… hahaha how ridiculous! \n\n\nWhat is the test actually? \n\nAnd you are quite mistaken. Even when people who are against Israel’s actions and want to see less deaths (like me and you both), no one is saying they are pro Hamas. They may be pro Palestina but in many people’s minds this doesn’t equal supporting a bunch of terrorist cowards like Hamas. Don’t conflate the two. \n\nThe only ones saying they are pro Hamas are other terrorists, religious lunatics (aka…) or the very uninformed like 19 year old “queers for Palestine.”\n\nThe thing with media is, they don’t report unbiasedly. So as a receiver we need to filter the information we see and make our own minds. No matter what the BBC says, nor NY post, nor an Israeli news channel. What matters are the facts and how they add together. \n\nDenying that there are tunnels under civilian structures is just an act of desperation. \n\nDenying that IDF is hitting civilians too is another. \n\n\nBut when you add 2 and 2 it still equals 4. \n\nIf the coward “leadership” of “Palestina” didn’t use their own population as shields, there would be much less civilian casualties. \n\nWe can see that happening in Lebanon. We can see that in Iran even. Israel hit several important targets with minimal civilian casualties. However, in Gaza, the cowards hold children as shields. It is a disgrace!"
