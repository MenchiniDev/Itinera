Mostly offer a deal food plus music. \nAlthough most of the local stay at home some prefer bigger settings and they dance the night away. \n\nI think this will more authentic than going to a pub after 12am to drink. It will be overcrowded plus overpriced.\nRestaurant and then at the Skenderbeg square for the concert."

Prices are double compared to other days, a bottle can be 200€ and open bar maybe 75€.\nPrices might have changed, I have 5+ years that I haven’t been out in NYE. But I have been to restaurants and it has been so much worth it."
