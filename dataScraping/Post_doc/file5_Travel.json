The mosque has a capacity for over a hundred thousand worshippers. When we reached we found a single soldier. Who kindly called another gentlemen who unlocked the doors and let us in. It was surreal to be in a huge mosque with just four people. \n\nPicture 7: a park.\n\nPicture 8: square infront of the mosque.\n\nPicture 9: ministry building.\n\nPicture 10: once again the mosque.\n\nVisiting the new capital was a surreal experience. We have not met a single sole whilst their who was not employed by the state. We were constantly asked by millitary personal, police, and a guy in civilian clothing with a visible pistol, to not take pictures of all kinds of buildings.\n\nThe new capital is extremely unwalkable as distances are huge, and the city is clearly build for cars. At some point we had to cross a 16 lane road, fortunately there was not car traffic, other than occasional construction workers and security forces. \n\nThe building are huge. The city features the highest tower in Africa and the largest mosque. All that‚Äôs missing now is a population.",

Like if the new city is built around an existing rail line so a station can be added and residents can get to the next big city by train within 30 mins then people can move into the new city(town at this stage) while still having their old job in the old main city. Over time businesses will move into the new local office space for people to get jobs at.\n\nThere's a town being built near me soon on a massive bit of farmland which should have done the same. It's right up against a rail line which would be around 25 mins to Central London if it had a station there, but there's not adding a station and they're limiting it to 5,000 car dependant mostly terraced/townhouse style homes I think. It could have easily had 35,000+ mostly apartment style homes without being too dense and still having at least 1/3rd of green space. They would have sold every home instantly with London commuters and it would have helped the housing shortage a bit. I think it would easily be a very sucessful city if they decided to try.",

Wikipedia says better than I can: \n\n> By requiring that nobles of a certain rank and position spend time each year at Versailles, Louis prevented them from developing their own regional power at the expense of his own and kept them from countering his efforts to centralise the French government in an absolute monarchy. The meticulous and strict court etiquette that Louis established, which overwhelmed his heirs with its petty boredom, was epitomised in the elaborate ceremonies and exacting procedures that accompanied his rising in the morning, known as the Lever, divided into a petit lever for the most important and a grand lever for the whole court.\n\n...\n\n>Louis thus compelled and seduced the old military aristocracy (the \"nobility of the sword\") into becoming his ceremonial courtiers, further weakening their power. In their place, he raised commoners or the more recently ennobled bureaucratic aristocracy (the \"nobility of the robe\"). He judged that royal authority thrived more surely by filling high executive and administrative positions with these men because they could be more easily dismissed than nobles of ancient lineage and entrenched influence. It is believed that Louis's policies were rooted in his experiences during the Fronde, when men of high birth readily took up the rebel cause against their king, who was actually the kinsman of some. This victory over the nobility may thus have ensured the end of major civil wars in France until the French Revolution about a century later",
