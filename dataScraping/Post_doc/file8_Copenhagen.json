Weâ€™ve called the police multiple times, theyâ€™ve refused to even do a mental health check. Weâ€™ve contacted the building management who didnâ€™t do anything. \n\nSo now weâ€™re still writing every instance down and will contact kommunen next AND continue to call the police if it sounds like she might be banging her head against things or hurting herself",

Call 114, they can send police, ambulance (who can call a doctor if necessary) or if in Copenhagen the Sociolance (social ambulance). \nIf this is your concern, I would always recommend calling first then they can take the next steps to help the (possible) patient. \nIf they decide the person is not clinically insane, then you can always document disturbances to your landlord afterwards - as it's annoying for you but not a medical emergency issue. \nHoping for the best for both of you! ðŸ¤ž",
