    "body" : "I donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m downvoted for this, but please consider this OP, since you say you love fireworks so much.Â \n\nThe ban is there for a reason. Each year fireworks kill thousands of birds and other wildlife. Pets get terrified even at home, because it feels like explosions right outside your window. Prague also hosts thousands of Ukrainian refugees, to whom the sound of explosions may be triggering, especially the kids.Â \n\nA few fireworks right at midnight wouldâ€™ve been fine, but people are idiots and do it with complete disregard for others. Itâ€™s more than a week from NY and already they are exploding every night all over my neighbourhood, and then usually a few days after too. Itâ€™s impossible to have a calm fucking walk anytime on the 31st, I try to go out with my dog as early as possible before the night but even from 6 pm itâ€™s already shitshow. Once I was walking him around 3 pm (!) and a petard blew up less than a meter away from us.Â \n\nWhat used to be my favourite holiday as a kid (not because of fireworks but family time) is now nothing but stress because of assholes who canâ€™t enjoy themselves without getting wasted and exploding stuff.Â \n\nSo yeah fuck your fireworks.Â ",

From around when it gets dark to about when the drunks run out of fireworks and/or fall asleep. The climax of the show is around midnight, as per tradition. I'd say the level of intensity is pretty similar to that of a show paid for by most cities, but the actual fireworks are much smaller and the show lasts hours....so 10/10?\n\nIt's fun in a chaotic way. I've been just outside my flat in the local square, and above the city on a hill near petrin. It's beautiful and cool. \n\nIf you're not into fireworks......get some earplugs, hole up in as inner of a room as you can, and gird your loins.",

I'd say 2y back I watched a man light off some from the window of his flat, while a crowd of others lit them off behind me. \n\nLast year I was on nusle bridge and there were easily 20 groups lighting them off within 100m of us. Plus all the people around the city. Heck, there was a 20 minute display just across our block around 10pm last year. \n\nI'd recommend walking about anyways. If you could get up to the hill around the castle, that would be a nice view. Or nusle bridge.

    "body" : "From my experience: there are places where it's known that people shoot fireworks from. It's not some underground stuff, for example one of the places is top of Venceslav Square (not sure how current it is, haven't been there since before covid), one is right on the NÃ¡mÄ›stÃ­ MÃ­ru (I've been there personally 2021/2022, watched from window year later). \n\nUsually people put the boxes of fireworks in the middle of cleared area and light them. It's all on you to be safe to yourself and to others, don't be stupid and light it until other people clear the immediate area, don't put the boxes too close to others, don't come back in until all current fireworks went off etc. Police does go around and watch out, but generally speaking they will let you be unless you're too drunk, careless, stupid to blatantly light it right before them, or something goes wrong. I saw one of the boxes go wrong, not sure what happend whether it was set too close to other fireworks or just faulty, but it kinda exploded instead of shooting fireworks straight up. Some sparks went into circle of people around the area, no major injuries just slight little burns on few people, barely noticeable. But it did get attention of police and they went closer to investigate. One guy immediately started running and they went after him, no idea what happened if they caught him or if he managed to get into house before they caught him. But the point is - they were right there where people actively shoot the fireworks, they didn't do anything until something went wrong and frankly if the guy haven't started running, they would have no idea who's fireworks did it, since there were 3 separate groups with big fireworks and multiple other people with those small pipes that just shoot sparks. \n\nNo idea if it's still like that though, I've had kids since then and there's no way I'm going out into that hell with little babies.",
