Thanks for the list - it hits  the main attractions that many first timers would like to see.  I wont be coming to Rome in 2025 due to the jubliee.\n\nBTW, the wonderful turtle fountain in the Jewish quarter is also being cleaned.  There are a bunch more things that I can't ever recall, but c'est la vie. I didn't keep notes.  We have seen our friends here and had a wonderful time and it's not all gloom and doom if you're coming....  but if you're planning a FIRST trip you might want to take all this into consideration.\n\nCiao."
