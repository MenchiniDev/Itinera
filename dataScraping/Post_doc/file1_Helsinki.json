There are fixed price airport shared taxis ( it's really a minibus), at least there used to be. I'm not sure if those exist anymore. Those are the cheapest. \n\nAnd you're probably not the only person trying to get downtown, so maybe sharing a cab could be possible. It's holiday pricing, so it won't be cheap.",

It seems a bit odd turning up at a place without knowing the basics about transport and food! No offense intended, just genuinely curious.",
