And had to put all my belongings in black trash bags and leave them outside in the AZ sun. It did the trick but it was a horrendous 6 months trying to get rid of them. One day I got home and took my shorts off to shower and when I finished I saw a bedbug crawling on my shorts. Just absolutely traumatic not knowing if you have one in your clothes or in your backpack, etc. Makes it real hard to ever relax and your home becomes anything but a safe haven.
