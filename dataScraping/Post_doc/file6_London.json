The animals were cramped and in its long history they were very badly treated but I think from most accounts they weren't living in little cubby holes in a sort of museum space. According to [this](https://historynavigator.org/2018/03/04/the-animals-in-the-tower-a-brief-history-of-the-royal-menagerie/) brief history, conditions were much improved towards the end. I suspect the original picture is simplistic.",

The menagerie, which operated from the 1200s to 1835, housed a variety of exotic animals, including lions, a polar bear, and an elephant2. The animals were kept in relatively small, confined spaces, often in separate towers or enclosures within the Tower. Visitors could pay to see these animals, and the menagerie was a popular attraction for Londoners and visitors alike.\n\n>The historical records and illustrations suggest that the conditions were quite cramped and not ideal for the animals, but the concept of displaying wild animals in this manner was common at the time\n\n-Copilot",
