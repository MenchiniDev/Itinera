I would not recommend using a different orthodontist for follow-up than braces. \n\nThat means either using some here for everything, or committing to returning frequently (6 8 times per year?) to your orthodontist in another country.\n\nIf you need them for medical reasons, they can be partially funded by the national health system.",
