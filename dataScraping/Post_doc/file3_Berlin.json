    "body" : "While it's fun to criticize BVG, and I don't pretend like they're perfect, bus service faces a lot of issues that make things challenging. \n\n1-there is a shortage of drivers and getting new ones trained takes time.  Maneuvering those buses on an empty road is hard enough, fill it with a lot of cars, traffic lights and pedestrians and the complexity goes way up.\n\n2-car traffic is everywhere and many roads in Berlin are single lane in each direction. The buses get stuck just like everyone else.  Even when there is a bus lane, it is not unusual for a car to be traveling in it.\n\n3-buses must drive defensively.  If an accident was avoidable, even if it wasn't the driver's fault, they will still get in trouble. I've certainly seen lots of behavior from car drivers where they absolutely do not respect the bus.\n\n4-traffic lights and their timing is another problem although this affects everyone. Most lights in Berlin seem to be on a timer with no smarts to them. As someone who likes to ride his bike, going 3 lights without hitting a red is pretty much impossible. Better technology around this would improve everyone's lives.",

It has lots of turns, low visibility, pedestrians, children walking home from school and Kindergarten and cyclists not expecting a bus racing down the street at 50 km/h.  \nI see this happen every fucking day. \nAnd that's just my street. \n\nI also vividly remember how a bus driver hit an old man on a bicycle slowly cycling down Sonnenallee. He hit him with his mirror and almost killed the dude. The driver was going way too fast and didn't overtake with the appropriate safety margin.   \nThe driver was completely unfazed and would've almost continued if passengers wouldn't have demanded that he stop.\n\nOh, and then there were these two times a bus almost ran me over because they were going too fast. \n\nBVG has the worst trained drivers and creates bad incentives by scheduling the time tables way too tight.",

What could help on the other hand is a better, more dependable public transport. So here I am crossing fingers that BVG will start on routes that are easy to handle for the robobuses.",

Fact is that the jobs that are left become more and more rare/useless/inefficient. \n\nI think that is why there is such a worry about replacing jobs. The bus drivers become unemployed through no fault of their own, but there are no jobs that they can pick up, or it will be something among the lines of \"filling out numbers in an excel file while not really understanding why or what for\" \n\nI'm just not convinced that autonomous driving will really help the BVG in the long term. Why not start with subway lines that are way less prone to outside interference?",
