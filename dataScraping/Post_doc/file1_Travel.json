There were church groups bringing people food at random airports all across America. No hotels available, no cars left to rent just thousands stuck in airports day in and day out."

    "Body" : "Cairo airport for 4 days.\n\nI went on a business trip to Cairo and when I was going through immigration, the guy took my passport and said he had to check something. \n\nWaited for an hour or so, then I asked another agent where the guy who was handling my passport will be back. He goes and checks and tells me the guy has left for the day and he has no idea where my passport is.\n\nI ask to speak to their boss who takes me to his office and attempts to call the guy who I had originally dealt with and he doesn’t answer. The guy tells me I have to wait at the airport until the guy comes back to work the next day. \n\nNext day rolls around and I ask if the guy is back and they tell me he is sick therefore he won’t be coming in. I go back to their bosses office and he apologizes, and says he will send someone to the guys home to find out what he did with my passport. \n\nNext day rolls around and there are more excuses, at which stage I call the Canadian embassy and explain this bizarre scenario I am faced with. The same day, a guy from the Canadian embassy comes to the airport and verifies some details, and the next day I am issued with an emergency passport so I can fly back home.\n\nSo It turns out that I was purposely being messed around with because of the purpose of my visit. I was on a business trip to bid on a project, and the only other company that was bidding on the project was a company run by the Egyptian military. They basically didn’t want to have a fair bidding process so what better way then to have your only competition lose out as a “no show” by engaging in shenanigans at the airport."

Fantastic, I know. But I had a nap on the floor, watched the sunrise, had some coffee, and finally made it to the 2:30pm flight.\n\nBut, no. Flight was delayed, then delayed some more. Then we boarded, then we had to de-board. Then I watched the sunset, and we were delayed some more. Then finally we were able to take off, at 10:30pm, 8 hours later. So a 16 hour layover in Newark, after a red eye flight.\n\nAnd then we flew to Lima, Peru. An 8 hour flight. Made it to my hostel (a horrible cramped hostel with everyone sound asleep) about 35 hours after leaving my accommodation in Portland.\n\nUnited gave me a $150 credit, and a $10 meal voucher. If this happened in Europe they'd have given me $625 cash, and covered all my meals."

    "Body" : "Arrived at LAX before TSA opened to fly back to SEA on Spirit. Board as normal, then the mechanical delays started. On and on it went, with very little communication from Spirit. And, as many of you know, it isn't easy to move between terminals at LAX. So I sat. When Spirit finally cancelled the flight, I zoomed down to ticketing to get my options. Since Spirit didn't interline, I took my refund and hopped on the phone with Alaska to see what they could do (they were awesome). This isn't a \"bash on Spirit post\" but it explains my timing. So, a family member had credit on Southwest and got me a ticket via OAK... and misspelled my name. So I hoofed it to T1 to see what I could do. As I was on the phone with my family member, explaining that I'd already been at LAX for 9 hours, the guy in front of me in the WN line, when it was his turn, told me to go ahead of him because \"you need the help more than I do.\" I get to the ticket counter and the WN agent quickly fixed my ticket, tells me I got the last seat... and the flight is delayed. Because of course. The TSA agent did a double-take when I went through because apparently I didn't look too good. Spent time in T1 and then flew to OAK and then to SEA where a friend picked me up. So I spent 12 hours at LAX, a few at OAK, and have to say one of the most amazing flight attendants ever on the WN OAK-SEA segment (and I wrote to WN to tell them how amazing she was). I love airports but... ooof. A dozen hours at LAX."

Delays to Boston continued until late in the evening. Four of us passengers got together to rent a car and drive up. Just then another airline announced the fog had lifted enough to fly into Boston. So 40 or so passengers boarded, it was a smooth flight, but I swear the approach was at an altitude of fifty feet or so over Boston Harbor for several minutes before landing. All told about a 14 hour delay/trek."

One year I was going to Southern-ish California to visit a friend - lived in the Lake Tahoe area at the time, so the plan was to fly from Reno to SF, then switch to a \"puddle jumper\" to San Luis Obispo (smaller city on the central coast). Shouldn't have been more than an hour for each leg, plus maybe an hour layover between. But when we got to SFO it was so foggy, they had to delay the flight while the weather cleared. I probably sat there for about 4-5 hours, before they finally said it was clear to leave... flew to SLO, attempted a landing, fog was still too thick, so they dumped us at LAX instead! Another 2 or so hours there (they gave us meal vouchers at least 🙄) before we finally got BACK on the plane and were able to land at SLO.\n\nI think the total travel time ended up being like 12 hours; I literally could have driven there faster! I've also had some overnight cancellations/delays, but in those cases I leave and get a hotel room. Even if they're not sure how long it'll be, I'd rather just rebook than sit there endlessly. That's what I did when a tornado diverted a Baltimore-Chicago-SFO flight to Louisville, Kentucky of all places. I just got a room, and flew home via Houston the next day instead."

If you have 4+ hours between flights it’s usually worth it if you were planning on eating and having a couple of beers anyway with the high prices airports have in the normal restaurants/bars.\n\nThe really good lounges also have ”hotel rooms” that you can use depending on availability and most have showers etc. ”free of charge” if you’ve bought lounge access.\n\n(You can often pre bok and pay before your trip to guarantee you access on the airlines/airports website.
