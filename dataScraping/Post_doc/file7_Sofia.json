Another option is that most of these people are foreigners, I personally wouldn't exchange at Tavex and never used them for that."

I can say Bulgarian employers and employees are the only ones who are paying their shares of the tax burden. Singapore had a flat 17% on \"chargeable\" income, gross - exemptions, but good accountants can do magic with the exemptions. In the USA it is even crazier you can pay easily zero tax otherwise federal is 21% and state can be from 0 in Wyoming to 11.5 in New Jersey."
