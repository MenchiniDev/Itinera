Consider checking out [some recent threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Birmingham/search/?q=apartments+OR+apartment&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=new&sort=new) about apartment hunting. **Avoid renting from H2 at all costs**, even as abundant as their properties are and as cheap as rent seems [(see an abundance of horror stories here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Birmingham/search/?q=h2&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=new&sort=relevance). Consider reaching out to [RentMonster](https://rentmonster.net/), a free local apartment hunting service that's found a ton of /r/Birmingham -sters their apartments to help you find a non-H2 property. Also consider checking out [Dwell](https://www.livewithdwell.com/availability/) properties, who is pretty well regarded by this subreddit, or also consider driving around looking for signs for private landlords.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
