For geeky stuff, there is Národní technické muzeum and Národní zemědělské muzeum, both near Oko. You can visit Žižkovská televizní věž, quite literally an outstanding piece of architecture offering spectacular panoramic views of the city.\n\nAlso, check out the pinned post and the Honest Guide Youtube channel (witch feels like a generic answer on this sub, but mostly because it simply works). Enjoy your stay and feel free to hmu with any questions.",
