This is an old scam, sometimes they include their children too.\n\nThey want to gain the empathy of the people by asking for the formula first.  When they buy it for them and hand it to them, they will engage in a conversation and start sharing how desperate and terrible their situation is.\n\nThe formula is only the catch, they usually target women and old people. If someone is willing to buy the formula they know they are likely to give them money too.\n\nThat's why he said it is not the good formula, he wanted to manipulate you into giving him money instead of going back to the store. That's why he said that nonsense about the expiry date, but then he felt like he can't scam you so he just moved on to the next person."

Instead, the scammer will call you later, claiming to be in a desperate situation and needing to borrow more money. The same scam is common near gas stations, where they claim to need cash for fuel or a bus ticket.
