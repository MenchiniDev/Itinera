They both have their own phone app, and both of them offers the same Wochenticket for K√∂ln (1b). What is the difference? Or if you buy the ticket in the KVB or VRS app, you get the exact same ticket you can use the exact same way?\n\nIs it a good idea to buy the ticket in the app at all? Or is it better/easier to get it in a paper form (I assume they have some ticket machines at the Central Station and probably at most/any stops)? When we travelled to Amsterdam, I learned that their mobile app had some limitations (you need to take special doors to get on/off because you cannot scan the mobile ticket just wherever you want), so in Amsterdam I ended up buying a regular ticket instead... This is why I'm asking.",

One of the only ones I found was that you could take a RE2/RE4/RE3 from the regional station at the airport and go to Koblenz (Some suggested switching with an s Bahn) then in Koblenz take a RE5 Bahn to K√∂ln. Is this allowed with the ticket? I know there's ticket to fly but it's more expensive as we would still buy the Deutschland ticket.",

Furthermore we are looking for a bar where we can rent out a room or part of the bar for a couple of hours. This so that we can comfortably drink and chat. After this bar, we are looking for a nice spot were we can get our dance on. Preferably with people in our own age range :D. And to close it off, we are looking for a nice club for the after hours. It has to be spacious and it would be nice if there are more than 1 rarea, so everybody can enjoy themselves.   \nI know I am asking an awful lot. But it would mean the world to me if you would help me along. Cologne is an enormous city and the night life is pretty overwhelming. I like to hear from you. Thanks!!",
