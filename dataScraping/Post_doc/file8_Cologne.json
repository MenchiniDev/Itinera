They both have their own phone app, and both of them offers the same Wochenticket for K√∂ln (1b). What is the difference? Or if you buy the ticket in the KVB or VRS app, you get the exact same ticket you can use the exact same way?\n\nIs it a good idea to buy the ticket in the app at all? Or is it better/easier to get it in a paper form (I assume they have some ticket machines at the Central Station and probably at most/any stops)? When we travelled to Amsterdam, I learned that their mobile app had some limitations (you need to take special doors to get on/off because you cannot scan the mobile ticket just wherever you want), so in Amsterdam I ended up buying a regular ticket instead... This is why I'm asking.",
