So the north connection between Bratislava and Vienna does not work. You have to take the south route from Bratislava-Petr≈æalka. You can take a bus 93 from Central Station or city center (President Palace) to Bratislava-Petr≈æalka bus stop to get there. You do not need a bus ticket if you already have a valid train ticket from Bratislava to Vienna. The train leaves hourly at HH:16 and the journey takes 59 minutes.\n\nTaking a train is more comfortable than a bus.",

    "body" : "**Option 1 (taxi + Flixbus coach)**: There is Flixbus leaving at 22:00 from Bratislava Bus Station (Nivy) or another option is to catch it 22:15 from city center (SNP Bridge) which goes directly to Vienna. The price is about 10 EUR (flixbus.sk). I would actually sugeest you to take Uber or Bolt since it is evening and there will be no car traffic. It would be up to 10 EUR. Public transit would most likely not get you there on time.\n\n**Ootion 2 (trolleybus 61 + bus 93 + train)**: The other option is to take a public transit to Bratislava Central Station (hlavna stanica) with direct line no. 61. It has 15 min headways, leaving HH:14, HH:29, HH:44 and HH:59 from the stop in front of the Airport building. Then you just switch to bus 93 which get you within 10 mins to Bratislava-Petr≈æalka. You can take Uber/Bolt/Hopin taxi (install them in advance). Do not take other taxi service, they would most likely scam you and you end up paying 30-50 EUR. The train is leaving 23:16 and cost 18.50 EUR (it is actually a return ticket) or maybe you can catch the earlier one with taxi.
