    "Body" : "You can definitely get Mexican chiles in adobo there, but I think OP is looking for a Filipino product, which is a different dish despite the same name. If so, best bet for that is an Asian grocer, maybe across the street from Tecolotes. I doubt culantro will be available anywhere, but for that Tecolotes is worth a try."
