    "body" : "Did a self-drive trip across Namibia from Windhoek to the far south and back up north again. The landscapes are simply out of this world as is the wildlife.\n\nThe pictures don't do the country justice as there is so much more to see and do than what can be seen in the slideshow. I didn't even include a picture of all the lions that I have spotted in Etosha park. Neither is there a picture of the cozy beachside town Swakopmund which is a great starting point for desert tours. And don't get me started on the amazing Spitzkoppe mountain and the cavemen paintings at the Brandberg.\n\nThe landscapes in Namibia seem so unreal, you'd think that you are on a different planet. And the best thing: it's a very affordable country. To do a safari there is incredibly cheap compared to Eastern Africa. The park entrance fees are just a few dollars a day and there is plenty of wildlife even though it's less than in Kenya or Tanzania. One month is barely enough to scratch the surface. I could've easily kept myself entertained there for months to go.",

I am primarily interested in wildlife and in particular bird watching.\n\n As a side note -earlier this year in Oman I drove 40km thru the desert on a very, very, very rough gravel road in a Peugot sports car with very thin tires (google maps didnt tell me the road was gravel lmao). I didnt see a single other vehicle the whole way but there were plenty of blown tires on the side of the road.",

Police is usually nice too, didn't have to pay any bribes. \n\nPetrol is easy to get and widely available. The only place where you might have difficulties to fill up the car is inside Etosha national park as the gas stations inside the park might not sell you more than 20 litres at once so it's best to fill up outside the park to have enough range.\n\nThe biggest danger is driving too fast on the gravel roads. A lot of tourists have accidents there because they are on a tight schedule and race between destinations. It's best to take it slow. Other than that it's a safe country to visit for tourists.",

    "body" : "Yes i did it solo. You don't need a 4x4 in Namibia but i would recommend an SUV because the gravel roads are full of potholes and you have a much better view of the animals from a higher seating position.\n\nYou can do all of Etosha by yourself in a regular car but if you feel like it you can also book game drives from tour operators or lodges. Entrance fee to the etosha park is just around 8 dollars a day. A 3 hour guided game drive around 30-50 dollars. Bird watching is best in the rain season (so this time of the year). All other animals are easier to spot in the dry season as they are forced to visit the waterholes.\n\nIf you want to visit places like Sossouvlei, it's no problem to book a shuttle or tour to take you across the 4x4 roads. That's cheaper to take the shuttle than to rent a 4x4 if you don't use it for any other kind of offroading.\n\nJust as in Oman, you will see plenty of blown tires on the side of the road in Namibia. I had two flat tires. Maybe you are lucky and won't have tire damage but for me it was worthwile to have the car fully insured. Be prepared to change a tire if needed but aside from that the main roads are safe and not difficult to drive on, even a Toyota Corolla would do (or a VW Polo that the locals use). It's just not comfortable in a small car and you don't have good clearance.",

    "body" : "I did it solo and rented a 4x4 Toyota Hilux from Europcar (the big rental companies at the airport are all good and provide very reliable and new cars). Cost was around 90 dollars a day + an additional 200 dollars for full coverage insurance (external from Discovercars,, they later compensated me fully for two tyre repairs). \n\nThere are a lot of tourists around so it's usually no problem if you get stuck during the day, just don't drive alone in the evening or at night. The big rental companies also all have 24 hours support hotlines (even though some remote areas have no cellular network). I had one tyre burst and another one deflated. Both times people stopped to help. I also changed the tyre for another group of stuck tourists who weren't able to change the tyre themselves. And there are plenty of repair shops who will provide you a new tyre and fix any issues on the car.\n\nIf you only drive the main roads then you don't need a 4x4 (also not for Etosha). A simple SUV with a good clearance and high seating position is enough. If you want to go offroad or drive on sand then a 4x4 is a must. \n\nIf you go anywhere offroad to see wildlife or nature (like for example the forest elephants in the riverbed or on some sand dunes) then it's best to take a local guide with you who will sit next to you and guide you. This is a person that will show you where to find wildlife and they can also arrange for a local to tow you out of the sand if you get stuck. A tourist travel partner won't be of big help if you need to be towed from a riverbed full of elephants.\n\n  \nHaving said that, there are also tours to the sand dunes and river elephants with local drivers so you don't need to drive any challenging routes if you don't want to.",

    "body" : "I also was there solo this year in late May. 4x4 is not needed for the main routes and Etosha. Still the roads can be pretty corrugated and bumpy so something with at least high clearance is recommended.\n\nThat said I went with a 4x4 truck (Toyota Hilux) with rooftop tent from namibia2go. It was about 1700€ with all camping equipment and full insurance for 17 days. I absolutley recommend to also go beyond the main routes and explore the desert and other remote places if you have the time. Of course you really need to have a safety system in place here in case you get stuck somewhere and bring enough water and food. Either tell someone you trust to call for help if you don't check in with them in time or bring a satellite messenger like a garmin inreach. \n\nOne highlight \"offorad\" for me was going to the Messum Crater from Cape Cross. Knowing you're the only human being in a vast radius together with the otherworldly landscape really is a magical experience. https://vgy.me/album/5qcCMrAB\n\nThe other was camping in the middle of the Namib-Naukluft national park. There are several primitive, unmanned campsites where you need to get a cheap permit beforehand. The sites are very far from each other so you don't notice the presence of other people. When I was there I checked out all of them and they were all unoccupied anyway. The ones at Blutkuppe seemed very nice and not that long of a drive but the one at the [Rock arch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qbc4XEs2oJawzoaD8) are just stunningly beautiful: https://vgy.me/album/4yzvQ6om\n\nEtosha, Spitzkoppe and Sossusvlei are in every guide book anyway and are really worth the visit. If you don't have a lot of time I would skip the south with Fish river canyon and Lüderitz for the first visit tbh. Not that it's bad but it's just a really long-ass drive better spend exploring sights not as distant.\n\nAmeib Farm with Phillips Cave and Bulls Party rock formations are not that well known but also really worth staying and exploring. The best commercial campsite I stayed at was \"At Kronenhof\". Huge private bathroom and kitchen building for every campsite and the couple running the farm is just so friendly and hospitable.",

Book directly through the government website.\n\nBook the car early. The 4x4 and camping trucks sell out the quickest. If you're too late you might be forced to use a sketchy local rental agency with old and unreliable cars and no roadside assistance. Book either through the big rental companies at the airport or a reputable local provider like Namibia2go.\n\nMany accomdations could've been booked spontaneously on the same day during my time there so you don't need to pre-book for every day if you prefer a spontaneous trip.
