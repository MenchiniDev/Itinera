    "body" : "You can buy CBD hash in Hungary, but keep in mind in, that in the EU THC is max 0.20% under the current legislation otherwise it comes illegal.\n\nAlso, I wouldn’t recommend smoking it in public. The Hungarian police have a quite strict stance on the topic. A few years ago, they raided a CBD shop before they even opened on Kertesz utca. So, unless you want to spend a few hours explaining that it’s CBD, just don’t do it.\n\nEdit: Adding link: [https://www.origo.hu/itthon/2020/09/bezartak-egy-kabitoszert-arusito-uzletet-a-vii-keruletben](https://www.origo.hu/itthon/2020/09/bezartak-egy-kabitoszert-arusito-uzletet-a-vii-keruletben)",
