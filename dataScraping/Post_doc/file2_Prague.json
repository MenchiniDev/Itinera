We are coming on 12/26 and leaving early 12/30.  I have a 9 year old with special needs who loves live music.  I've found a lot of classical live music options, but are there any other live music options that you would suggest for a child?  She honestly loves any type of music -- from rock to polka to hip hop to dance.  Our last Christmas trip was San Miguel de Allende and there was music every night in the town square and she was in heaven. TIA!",
