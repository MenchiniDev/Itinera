We are coming on 12/26 and leaving early 12/30.  I have a 9 year old with special needs who loves live music.  I've found a lot of classical live music options, but are there any other live music options that you would suggest for a child?  She honestly loves any type of music -- from rock to polka to hip hop to dance.  Our last Christmas trip was San Miguel de Allende and there was music every night in the town square and she was in heaven. TIA!"

It doesn't have to be Christmas eve, I just want to try the food! (I live here)\n\n  \nI'd really prefer some local pubs/ restaurant without tourists and too many expats, for example my jams would be Restaurant Na Staré Faře, Lidová jídelna Těšnov, Restaurace U Pramene, or maybe U Sadu. Lokál is too expat-y for me. Although I'm not sure if local pubs serve Christmas menu. Thank you!!"
