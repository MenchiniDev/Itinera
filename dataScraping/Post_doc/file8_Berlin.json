I think it specifies in textbooks so could imagine it has english titles :) Otherwise try kleinanzeigen, but you’d have to be specific and search subjects or disciplines? Also I would recommend Cafe Tasso near frankfurter tor, they have a great english book section downstairs on the shelves on the left, and all the books are something like 2/2,50€ each. I’ve found some great ones there!",
