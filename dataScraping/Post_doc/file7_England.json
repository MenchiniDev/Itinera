Our local bank is like a living room with sofas and coffee and all of the tellers are sat at desks. Not a plexi glass shield anywhere. All of the gas stations are pretty much the same way. Open desks no plexi glass. \n\nThe local store leaves things outside when it closes at night. Pallets of water, pumpkins in the fall, firewood and vending machines. I couldn‚Äôt ever imagine this growing up in Liverpool and it‚Äôs such a culture shock. The U.S. has its problems but small town America is amazing. \n\nI even remember walking down the town center and a group of scruffy looking 18-20yo were walking towards me. Instantly I tensed up expecting a confrontation and when they saw me they said ‚Äúhey how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù Then moved out of the walkway to let me past. It‚Äôs such a difference from a group of young men in Liverpool swinging a punch at me for driving by them on a bike."

Thankfully I've never had a run in with her but so many others have, it's genuinely scary that there are so many people like that out there now it makes me not want to do anything in case it attracts a lunatic. \n\nI think part of it is we've changed as a society to view everyone else as a problem and a burden, we need to spread the understanding that other people existing and being happy is a good thing.

My point is that, no, I think there are very real reasons as to why that change has occurred, and it‚Äôs not just because people felt like it ‚Äòin the home‚Äô. It‚Äôs because of a multitude of socioeconomic factors. \n\nDoes that mean that personal responsibility should be forgone? No, of course not. Does it mean that perhaps, a lot of people acting the way they are now might not have made those choices if they lived in a different environment? Maybe, yes. There‚Äôs a difference between a reason and an excuse, and I was explaining reasons."
