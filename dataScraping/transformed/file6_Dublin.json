They usually arrive late afternoon so I wasn't too concerned when there was no sign of them earlier in the day. At one point I went to bring the rubbish out and I had to do a double take because there was an Amazon box in my feckin grey bin. I checked my email and there was a confirmation of delivery with a picture of the box in the bin. This was from around 11 in the morning. Me and my husband were both in the house. The fecker didn't bother ringing the doorbell, just fucked it in the bin and left."
