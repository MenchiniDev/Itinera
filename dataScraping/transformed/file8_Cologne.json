They both have their own phone app, and both of them offers the same Wochenticket for K√∂ln (1b). What is the difference? Or if you buy the ticket in the KVB or VRS app, you get the exact same ticket you can use the exact same way?\n\nIs it a good idea to buy the ticket in the app at all? Or is it better/easier to get it in a paper form (I assume they have some ticket machines at the Central Station and probably at most/any stops)? When we travelled to Amsterdam, I learned that their mobile app had some limitations (you need to take special doors to get on/off because you cannot scan the mobile ticket just wherever you want), so in Amsterdam I ended up buying a regular ticket instead... This is why I'm asking."

Your two requirements kinda exclude each other, if its vibrant and artsy its not quiet. Maybe Nippes, which can be very quiet but is still close to everything. Unless you have a very high income (120k ‚Ç¨+), its going to be very hard to find a place to live, even more so if you dont speak german. Btw please dont become one of the people who moves to Ehrenfeld because of the artists/clubs and then prices the artists out of the housing market and shuts the clubs down with noise complaints."

If you dont send an application within an hour or two of the flat being online, you usually dont even get an answer. So you not being german and not speaking German adds a little risk for the landlord (communication issues, you just leaving the country one day without paying rent for example). Since they have dozens of other applicants, the smallest additional risk can get you denied."
