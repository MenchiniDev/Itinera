    "Body" : "From the obituary of a local mayor.\n\n>And one of the most notorious moments during her time in that role was Dereham's great Christmas tree riot of New Yearâ€™s Day 1989.\n\n>It was an event that made national news at the time, with seven police officers sustaining injuries as they broke up a mob of 200 revellers.\n\nSo you're probably looking at Jan 2nd 1989 for the papers.  As I'm guessing that the crowd piled out if the pubs and nightclubs at kicking out time on Jan 1st morning.  Having celebrated NYE, which is when two people got the idea to climb the tree."
