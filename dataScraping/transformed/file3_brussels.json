Many people arrive alone, for a job / internship / study / ... and you can really feel the openness to meet new people here. It's not London or Paris. For most Belgians outside the city it's an unfamiliar place. Weather can be gray & wet, and public transport can be unreliable. All these things really guide people to the real value there is in building a small community and starting to feel like they belong here. Given most people were new & alone here one day, even established groups of friends are very eager to invite new members in, and adopt them in their circle. I truly think the level of depth in connections to be made here is quite unique."

I love that I get a decent apartment by paying 1k whereas i have friends in paris, ams, or berlin which with the same amount have little studios. Taxes are high its true, but overall you can find a good balance as there is an interesting job market. I really want to mention cinemas here. I really love the variety of small, independent cinemas. The amount of film festivals and everything that allows you to touch independent films. And also people here can be quite nice. I know people from all over the world and i have created my little friend families here.

Brussels has almost none of this, and it's great. It really removes a lot of pretention from foreigners who move to Brussels, which helps with the culture of the city on the whole. \n\nThis is probably helped by the fact that everyone learns that the correct attitude to take towards Brussels is to complain about it and to massively exaggerate its flaws. If rolling my eyes at this all the time is the price I pay for a city without much of a yuppie expat culture, then I'll pay it happily. \n\nOn a more serious note, I think Brussels offers a ton of activities and events for a city of its size, which is in no small part thanks to the density of (especially European) foreigner groups. It's expensive compared to much of the rest of the world, but compared to London, Paris, or Amsterdam, it's quite cheap. I would say that you get a lot of \"bang for your buck\" out of life here."
