    "Body" : "No no no! this is a factor but an unimportant one. \n\nThe problem is rent against mortgages. \n\nIf you asked a university graduate in the 80s or before what their plan was for life it would be move out of parents place rent for a while then earn enough to put a mortgage on a property then in 40 years time that would be theirs and they owned it all payments done and dusted.\n\nNone of that is true now but all the powers  that be still think this is true.\n\nRenting in London has no legal frame work other than market forces. So if an area that you live gets a new underground station and you were paying a certain amount there is nothing stopping the land Lord from raising the rent. From what I understand there is almost nothing that you as a renter can sign that will keep rent at x for y months. \n\nLand Lords therefore can buy a giant tower block from the local council on the cheep and fill them with human beings to cover a government mandate . Then renovate the empty ones so they are now spangly high end flats that no one in the building can afford. As such you can legit claim that the area has a higher average rent so you can bump up the original residents payments.\n\nThis has been going on in London  since the 80s and while the twats making all the money might speak a different language. This is not new and we as citizens have let this happen. To Mrs filtrop up stairs she didn't realise that who she.voted for in the 80s would allow organisations to kick her out 2024. But if she did she wouldn't have \n\nThat it is foreign money is so easy to demonise, but the reality is Poplar harca et all have been destroying affordable housing and bumping rents making your fellow country men homeless since the 80s with British people and British money.\n\nThat it is foreign money is not the problem it's our institutions that we rely on to play with a straight bat being cooped by that's with big check books.\n\nHow do we fix it ?...vote I don't care who for but vote if the voters turn out is less than 90% it's not a mandate of the people."

    "Body" : "Whilst unemployed allowance isn't weighted, other things - like Local Housing Allowance.\n\nAlso increased demand-side subsidies will jack up rents, supply being the same. If you give vast swathes of Londoners more subsidies to pay their rent, you empower landlords to increase rents - because the demand is now there. \n\nLandlords absolutely cannot \"do what they want\". They charge as much as they can, renters pay as little as they can - this is how a market works. Supply and demand is what sets the market price. \n\nThe UK spends more on housing benefit than any other country in the OECD - 1.5% of our entire GDP. It's especially generous in London due to the aforementioned Local Housing Allowance. We also have some of the highest levels of social housing of any city in the OECD - approaching 40% in many central boroughs. In some boroughs like Tower Hamlets, 60% of all housing is subsidised. Has any of that made renting in London cheap?\n\n\nThe only way to broaden the safety net is to build more housing."
