Iâ€™ve also been trying to get back into roller skating and yoga, those are always better with a friend! Additionally, I currently work with kids with autism which keeps me busy during the week, but Iâ€™d love to meet new people in the evenings/weekends and find some chill, like-minded people!"

Iâ€™m down with pretty much anything outside, motorcycles, bars/food, hangouts with pets (my wife and I have a Great Dane), and low skill video games. I also work in animation and do a little photography so open to anything creative!"
