And I was sitting in the first or last carriage (can't remember correctly).  \nIt was very quiet since most of the passengers where in the middle of the train.\n\nAnd to the note, I had the same thing happen to me. Saw the guy, moved my bag, walked off, other the course of multiple times back and forth.  \nIn hindsight, it was a friday eveneing, I was tired from the workweek. Took the train because I didn't want to drive myself. And was chilling, watching some Netflix.  \nI had a false sense of security. I had that feeling when boarding a plane, once you are seated and the doors are closed you wait until arrival.\n\nIt was an expensive lesson, ever since I lock my luggage to the overhead with a small chain and lock when traveling by international train."

It is not new, it is only more known because of the social media. Never leave any bags unattended, not for a second anywhere. I still see people in restaurants have their bags over their chairs and are sometimes shocked some is stolen out of it by a person sneeked behind for a moment.\n\nWhen these things happen to you this mostly could be avoided. So it IS your fault (EDIT: it is not really your fault but you could have avoided happening). Sadly criminals are everywhere and that will never change, only your behaviour can be changed."
