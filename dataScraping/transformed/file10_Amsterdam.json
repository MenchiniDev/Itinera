Not having to worry about zones/ day passes/ whatever, and paying as you go. **Kudos to GVB**! Really!"

He says he used to take a taxi to the Penny Bar, walk down to the canal, and walk down a large set of stairs to the canal. The bar was apparently just there and had very few seats. The vibe was like being in someones home. The food was excellent and apparently the owner and staff were very good at remembering guests, even after years passed.\n\nJust curious to see if I can find any more information about this place. Google searches havent yielded anything and I am not physically there, but i figured maybe someone knows someone who remembers the place. I want to find pictures and take my friend there for a trip down memory lane before he is too ill to travel, because this place held some of his fondest memories.\n\nThanks everyone!"

I’m sorry for asking another question about waste management, but I couldn’t find answers to some of my questions.\n\nI’ve checked Afvalwijzer, and it says that Restafval is collected twice a week (I live in Centrum).\n\n1. How are we supposed to keep organic waste for 3-4 days? If I cook something on Friday morning, my waste won’t be collected until Tuesday morning.\n\n2. Since keeping smelly trash for 4 days is a long time, and I live very close to Zuid, is it allowed to use Zuid’s underground bins?\n\n3. It says that trash is collected between 6:00 and 7:30. Does that mean I’m supposed to put it out around 6 am? I saw a similar question on reddit years ago, and people said everyone puts their trash out the night before. Is that true? I’ve only been living here for a few days, so I haven’t had a chance to check on my own.\n\n4. This question isn’t about Restafval but about paper and glass bins. For instance, if you have a bag of paper, what do you do with the bag? Do you take everything out of the bag and place it in the bin, then take the empty bag with you? Or if I use a disposable bag, can I throw it into the container as well?\n\nThanks!"

Dak is an incredible roaster and has a very modern tasting showroom (no food). Saint Jean also serves their beans and is a bakery with a modern feel, easier to get to as well. Sango is also right by the central station with interesting coffee choices, and is great to hang around a little while. I don't love their pastries though. Uncommon Cafe is a sit-down option as well for coffee tasting, pastries and food. I highly recommend their toasted banana bread dessert plate.\n\nFriedhats and Rum Baba are amazing roasters, but I wouldn't say their cafes have a modern feel like Blue Bottle. You also can find Friedhats coffee at OSLO, which has pastries but no seating.\n\nAlso, since I notice you're from Austin... I'm jealous of your tacos right now. One of the things AMS unfortunately doesn't do well/cheap 😭 But thankfully for you the coffee and pastries here are excellent."

Uncommon has two shops right across from eachother, one is a bit more basic, the other focuses on ferments and artisanal pastries/food. \n\nTry and find a bar that serves ossenworst if you want to try local meat products or grab a sandwich from Slagerij Vet on Zeedijk (broodje ossenworst met peper or broodje halfom). If a bar has a mostly wood interior, lots of old deco on the wall and smells of stale beer it's usually solid (for a super central place visit In 't Aepjen and order a beer with a jenever shot, ossenworst and cheese).\n\nIf you want to avoid super touristy restaurants I'd check out the Oud-West and Oost areas, both are gentrified but also predominantly residential areas.
