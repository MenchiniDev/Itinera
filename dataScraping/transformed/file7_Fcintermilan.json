He said, \"It was intelligent & justified. If it had been me, I'd have written worse.\"\n\nClass act through & through. \n\nFun Fact : One of the questions/ criticism was why the players think of him like a father (then leave the club to win elsewhere). Ronaldo, Adri, Recoba, JZ4 etc. all *loved* him."
