Less signings older than 30- no more Dzeko‚Äôs, or Mkhitaryan‚Äôs, or Acerbi‚Äôs. More young profiles like Nico Paz or Santi Castro. Players who may cost a bit, but may be worth double in the future. ‚ö´Ô∏èüîµ"

    "Body" : "- Inzy answered a question about Paz in the press con. That itself is confirmation that we're serious. He said he's been told his *personality & character* is quite good. That means the *technical* consideration & evaluation has already been approved.\n\n- His big quality is dribbling, which Inzy has (in the past) said our squad currently lacks. \n\n- His father is quite friendly with JZ4 (a subtle shot/ confirmation vis-a-vis Samar).\n\n- A report said Real are unlikely to buy him back cause they're already filled in that dept. Another said they've *already* exercised it to take him back next summer. Yet another said we'll use a Brahim-Milan style deal (long term option to buy back etc.).\n\n- Marotta said (and I paraphrase) \"we'll not make any deals in Jan. unless it's for a young talent we like, and the economic conditions are on our terms.  \n\nAll-in-all, we seem really serious, but it's probably for the summer."
