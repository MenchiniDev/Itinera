The cherry on top was the lovely Ass. Hotelmanager Sonia, who treated us very nicely and always with a smile. We will surely come back next time we will visit Köln!",

Despite having a room in an empty courtyard, music and party noises from the street could be heard very loudly until late at night, making it almost impossible to sleep.\n\nInternet was constantly down, the personel wasn't able to fix the problem during that night.\n\nBoth of these aspects made my business trip very annoying, because I needed internet for my office work and had to stay up much longer than I wanted.\n\nThis hotel, which feels more like a pension, would be okay if you just need a decent bed after partying or long-night-sightseeing.",

I appreciate the fact that they took into consideration that I had asked for a quiet room.\nThe staff is kind and competent, it's nice to speak to them.\nThe breakfast was lovely, maybe the part I enjoyed the most of my stay, there was plenty of choice and everything was delicious. The breakfast ladies were kind and fast in their service.\nThe bus stops are nearby, and so are shops and restaurants. The station is less than 20 minutes by foot, otherwise you can catch a bus.",

The staff refused to compensate the difference (!)\nVery loud: 'Soundproof' (as advertised) is a joke. We could not only hear, but also understand what both the neighbours and people in the hall were talking about. House noise, e.g. from bathrooms, was very loud as well. Moreover, people in the street could be heard until very late; so was the music club in the neighbouring block.",
