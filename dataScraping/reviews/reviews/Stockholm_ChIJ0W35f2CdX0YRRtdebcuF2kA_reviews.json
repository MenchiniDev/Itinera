There is no air conditioning and this summer was a bit hotter than usual, but I would let them get away with this. ðŸ˜Š Bathroom was clean and newly fitted. Bedding was comfortable and neatly made.\nBreakfast was a bit of let down. Not too much of a variety. Good for a stay if you want to be right in the heart of the city.",

Hotel is a little dated and rooms are missing facilities like a safe. Nice breakfast, mostly continental style of bread, fruit, creaks and cold meats but does have a cooked component of bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs and tomatoes.",

The things that I missed most - there was no hairdryer in the bathroom, no safe in the room and no fridge. Breakfast - acceptable (tasty, but nothing spectacular as originality or variety).",
