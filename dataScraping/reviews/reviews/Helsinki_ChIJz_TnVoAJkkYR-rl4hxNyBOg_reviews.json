            "text": "Quite a nice play to dine. Nice food and vibe. The foods are interesting as all Mediterranean foods are. The quality can be a tad higher with the meat themselvea. I took the lamb and others took the beef filled with feta cheese. I tasted the beef aswell and I liked the flavours better. Portions are good. The waiter didn't write things down so the food delivery was not smooth as he forgot who ordered what. However, they greeted and treated us nicely. Didn't try the pasta myslef but everyone were happy with the food. We also tried some baklava, and one of us didn't want the ice cream so she got two baklavas, if I knew I would have definitely done the same üòÅ",

The restaurant was full by 1.30pm. Food was excellent. Service was excellent. Atmosphere was excellent. The restaurant has been in Helsinki for 43 years, so that already tells something. It was our first time there, but definitely the last. Highly recommend.",
