            "text": "We arrived at the hotel on Thursday 22nd August. The hotel is very well located has nice rooms with a nice kitchen and terrace. However we had read in the comments that there were bed bugs. As a precaution we emailed the hotel to find out if they had taken the necessary steps to disinfect/treat the bedbugs. The hotel confirmed that they had. We left the hotel and one of our group ended up being eaten by bedbug bites... We don't want to denigrate the hotel  but I don't think they really took the necessary steps to treat these bedbugs. Make sure you check everything when you stay there!",

You had to go to the pub and ask the staff member who was already busy in the pub for help. The hostel was small and cozy. Can meet other travelers, but no events or anything like that. Decent stay for a couple nights.",
