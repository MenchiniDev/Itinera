In the bathroom you can expect beautifully scented cosmetics. We‚Äôve been greeted with much needed coffee, while in the room there was a small treat waiting for us.  The breakfast - pure perfection. But the most precious thing is the staff - professionals, who are really empathetic and always open to make your stay as pleasant as possible. Whenever we come to the Budapest, we will stay here.",

The hotel was very well located as well since it was close to a ton of nice places to visit, eat from and also a bus stop. Plus the area overall was very peaceful\n\nI strongly recomend this hotel for anyone who wants to take a trip here :)",

            "text": "All great!\nThe location is perfect. It is located very close to transport links such as metro, bus and tram. In addition, you can reach many restaurants and places to visit on foot. The atmosphere is very relaxing because the hotel is located in a leafy neighborhood. The rooms and bathrooms are nice and clean. The hotel staff is very kind, immediately providing for every need. Great value for such a place.\n\nP.S. For transport here you use the BudapestGo app, so I recommend you download it. Also if you want to order in your room from nearby restaurants I recommend you to use the Wolt app, which is a kind of Hungarian Just Eat. However, the food provided by the hotel restaurant is also great.",
