On the second day it was necessary to call them once more because they couldn't deliver the pizza within one hour. When the pizza eventually came, it had 21% higher price then just the day before. There was no receipt on neither occasion. And, at the end the dough was not baked well. Unfortunately, I am not able to recommend such service.",

The salad too salty, to the point where all you have is salt in your mouth.\nTook them 15 minutes from order to the table.\nThe schnitzel was from chicken breasts (not exactly Wiener, is it?), but warm, hence the two stars.\nJust avoid this place.",
