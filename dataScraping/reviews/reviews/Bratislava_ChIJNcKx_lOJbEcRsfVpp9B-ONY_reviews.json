            "text": "We ordered the food personally as our airbnb was very close to the place. Honestly, i dont think that the reviews do this place justice. Bear in mind we ate the pizzas as fresh as possible, so maybe some people had a bad experience with take away,  but it was very delicious, the crust was thin, the toppings were more than enough, with an extra drizzle of garlic oil - which they kindly offered. Make no mistake, this place is not fancy, not \"instagrammable\" maybe, but if you want a good, authentic pie you will not be disappointed.",

There was nowhere to sit since they were assembling a TV to go up on the wall so it was a little chaotic. It was all really just one room where everything was happening and the place where the pizza was made is right to the door so that is not really a pleasant - again im saying, more of a dispensary then a restaurant.\nThe pizza itself actually surprised us, it definetly wasnt the best and im no pizza making expert but i still expected it to be much more horrible than this. The dough was slim and the basil was not tasting too well and was spread unevenly.\n\nI would rate:\nService 2 stars\nPizza 3 stars\n\nAnd the final rating is 3 as it was better than my expectations.",
