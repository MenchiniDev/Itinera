As for the menu, the drinks are not classic and are for prices that do not deserve. I suggest you not to be deceived by the appearance.ðŸ¤¢ðŸ˜•ðŸ¤¢",

Someone needs to take him away as he is aggressive, my little girl, walking into the room, had a little meltdown in the hallway. The manager did not stop shouting at her and the child suffered a shock. We left and very upset. We will never return. I do not recommend my fate with that negative, very inhumane person to anyone.deserves no appreciation at all.",

If you stay in a single room, beware the bed is so small that you might fall off. The wifi mostly doesnâ€™t work. Bcoz of the location, the rooms are noisy as the glass is not soundproof. However, everything can be ignored by the amazing team who are always ready to help. Special thanks to reception team esp. Serena for being so helpful, kind, the breakfast lady & HK team. I would say I liked my stay only for the staff.",
