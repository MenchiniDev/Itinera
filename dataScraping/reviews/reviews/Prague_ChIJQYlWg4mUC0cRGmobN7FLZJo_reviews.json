The rooms were clean and elegant, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and although I didn't have time to experience it, they also provide spa services. You get at 10% discount voucher for the restaurant when you stay there, and they had an elevator.\nI personally found the mattress to be a tad hard for my taste, but it didn't prevent me from having a restful night. If ever I come back to Prague, I fully plan to stay here again!",

Many thanks to Veronika, the receptionist, who went far and beyond the call of duty.\nMy stay was very comfortable and the only hitch was that it was a fair walk from Prague centre. I think I walked a few miles a day. However, it did give me the chance to explore and enjoy all the sights of this amazing city.",
