I requested a quieter room at the front, but was told there were no available rooms or upgrades (apparently, front rooms must be requested in advance).\n\nMy standard room, while clean, was very basic, small and felt quite worn. There were signs of neglect, like painted-over sockets with peeling paint and fixtures that had seen better days. The space overall lacked the attention to detail and comfort expected of a four-star property. For instance, there was no tea or coffee set, and the iron provided was basic, along with a tiny, torn ironing board.\n\nBreakfast was a standard buffet with nothing memorable.",

I enjoyed the salmon and eggs every morning plus the wide variety of fruit, meats, breads and fabulous coffee. Helpful staff.  Clean. Security is a priority. Great location next to the Mathallen which has a large range of restaurants and bars all under one roof.  Easy access to town centers by bus (cash only or purchase tickets at 7-11).",

On day one, i did.\nOn the second day, i met a security guard who looked after the car park.\nHe advised me to move my bike and park it in P2, which was a level below. Motorcycles are free to park on P2. With a dedicated area. If I'd left it on P3, I'd have received a hefty bill.\nWhen you drive into the car park, you are greeted with only one entrance. However, further round are the other entrances.\nThe receptionist knew I was on a Moto, and really should have explained this.\nRooms are nice. Roomy and clean.\nBreakfast is fantastic. Huge selection. Everything you could want. Can get very busy at peak times.\nWe used this hotel for its location. The whole city is within 20 mins walking.\nI will use this hotel again.",
