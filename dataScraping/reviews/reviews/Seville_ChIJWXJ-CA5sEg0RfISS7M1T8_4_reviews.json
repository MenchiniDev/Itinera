We started with each a cup of tea and appreciated the traditional Moroccan pour (high pour) that fills the air with a wonderful aroma. Our food was delicious and the perfect way to add a few veggies into our the mix.",

The female staff is so professional and friendly that just made our day. We had the tagine, roasted veggies and pastela. The lamb was cooked perfectly. The mint tea is also delicious. Will def come when I come to Seville next. You’re all doing a fabulous job!",
