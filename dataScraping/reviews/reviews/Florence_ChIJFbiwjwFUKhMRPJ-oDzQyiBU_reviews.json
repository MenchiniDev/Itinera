            "text": "We had a quick stop here for the famous ice-cream coffee. It was raining very heavy in Florence on the day we visit, we walked in with dripping water rain coat, the store staff were very friends. Coffee is very nice, ice-cream is quite sweet, blending together it does make taste coffee creamy and smooth, just a bit too sweet for me. We did not sit down, just had our coffee at the counter, service is very fast.  The deserts and candies are displayed very nicely, lovely to look at.",

Normally to be seated you have to pay an extra fee, but since I was with my girlfriend who is disabled they let us take a seat free of charge. The waiter Tomas was exceptionally kind to us. The cafe is also very beautiful and worth the visit. Highly recommend!",
