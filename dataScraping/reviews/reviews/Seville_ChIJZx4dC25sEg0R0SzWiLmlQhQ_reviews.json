As it happens in many of these we’ll-established places in Spain, don’t expect the best service. Here it seems more about the experience. We had chistorra in white wine and it was quite good (6€). It seems that their specialty, however, is, solomillo, As is the practice in Sevilla, they charged us an extra 3€ for the bread which seemed a lot. They will charge you the bread whether you eat it or not so be aware.",

I called for reservations and was told they open at 9 pm.  We had just spent hours on a train and we wanted an early dinner.  So at 9 pm I walked into the restaurant and was shooed out.  At 9:15 I went back in and was told to leave again.  At this point I decided they simply were not worth going to and asked my family to go elsewhere but was outvoted.   We  were given dry bread in plastic packages when we sat down.  No butter.  Dirty wine glass was given to me and the waiter got upset when I didn’t want to drink out of it.  The staff was just rude.  They made it very clear we were not welcome.  The food was “okay”, I am waiting to see if I get sick from it.  Not a happy dining evening for us at all.",
