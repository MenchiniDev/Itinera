They spoke a little bit of french to make us smile and provide advice when selecting dishes with wine.\n\nThe food was well made with great taste and quantity. We really enjoyed it as it was well balanced.\n\nThe restaurant is made of wood everywhere and it gives a nice vibe.",

The waitress very patient with me since I was all over the place. I had the Golonka (pork knuckle,). It is a must. There is nothing like it. It was delicious, well seasoned, and tender. The beef tartare another delcicious dish. This was made in front of you. It was the best!!! Great experience in Warsaw, Poland. You will not be disappointed. Make sure you make reservations in advance.",

The food is simply out of this world, the staff is caring and friendly, and overall, the prices are worth it! I never had a beef tartar so good that you just eat it with a fork, no bread involved. The goose was amazing too. All the dishes on the menu are freshly made, and the portions are perfectly sized. If I was on my death bed and only had one last meal, it would be from Stary Dom üòç",
