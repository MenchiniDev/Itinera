Food was fresh and delicious. The rooms, depending on the standard, are cosy and nicely decorated. During our first stay, we received a good room, but it was facing the opposite wall of the hotel, so the view was somewhat missing, and the interior was quite dark. The second room was extremely nice, bright and calm. However, a big minus for me is the fact that you can't open the window in any of the rooms, and I terribly lacked some fresh air at night.",
