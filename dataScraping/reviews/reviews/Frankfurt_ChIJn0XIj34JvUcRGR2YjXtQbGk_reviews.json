Rooms are spacious and well decorated, you can ask to get a room with the view on Frankfurt skycrapers and the breakfast is good. Reception staff is very nice and helpful.",

We had a great night in the bistro on Friday and a lot of laughs with the bar staff and some locals! Tim arranged a room for me at short notice (discounted very reasonable rate) so I could be at the same place as my family whilst we were in Frankfurt. Lovely, clean, comfortable room and I slept very well both nights. Super relaxing, easy, comfortable stay! I would highly recommend both the hotel, but more importantly the staff. Fantastic. Well done all.",
