            "text": "Solid no frills, no fuss hotel. As others mentioned it's old school so you give them your room key every time you leave, but honestly I can't blame them especially during Oktoberfest fest when people would probably lose it otherwise. Location is right next to the festival grounds and about a 10 minute walk from the nearest train station so pretty simple to get to old town as well. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Shower is kinda small, but it wasn't a huge deal. The 24/7 warm drinks was awesome in the chilly weather!",

The breakfast was also very diverse and delicious. Tee and coffee was free. Very close to buses, trams and S-Bahn. Transportation is very easy. All the employees are friendly. Thank you for all!",
