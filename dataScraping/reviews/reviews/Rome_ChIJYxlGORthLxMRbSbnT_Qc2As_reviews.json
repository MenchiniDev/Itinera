Location is my favourite, because you can go walk in the park every morning or even reach the centre in 15 minutes walking through the park Borghese. The staff is fantastic and all the experience was so lovely ;)",

            "text": "Visited this 5-star hotel from the States!\n\nThe check-in process was easy and smooth. We were helped with our luggage during the check-in process. We were warmly greeted by the staff. We get to our room and were amazed at the amenities and cleanliness. We also enjoyed the welcome to our room with the sweet treats and welcome letter!\n\nWe started to unpack and relax and after a couple hours, we noticed that our room hadn’t cooled off – even tho we had turned the A/C down. We went down to speak with the front desk staff and without any hesitation they sent someone to check it out for us. Unfortunately, after a few more hours, the room still hadn’t cooled off. So, we had to go back down to the front desk to inform them that the A/C still isn’t working and we were offered a room switch. The ‘cold’ water pressure coming from the bathroom faucet was very weak. The second room was much more accommodating as the A/C worked great!\n\nThe continental breakfast starts at 6:45a and is really good, I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of options available. The staff was also friendly – especially when offering fresh squeezed orange juice. And the coffee… OMG, was the best.\n\nThe hotel restaurant is good for dinner, albeit, there was a bit of confusion regarding the vegetarian options/menu, but we were able to get it situated. The Pinto Grigio was the best part of our dinner reservation.\n\nThe outside pool area was a great place to relax and the water was just right – not too cold, not too hot. I enjoyed the fact of being able to order food/drinks poolside.\n\nI feel Parco dei Principi Grand Hotel is in a really good location and walking distance to a good pizza restaurant we found. Whenever we did decide to venture out into the city, the travel time was no more than 27 minutes, which is really good in my book.\n\nThe checkout process wasn’t as good as check-in. With having 4 employees behind the counter, we had to wait for about 5-10 minutes as everyone scrambles behind the counter as if they were alluding to being super busy. After the 1 employee finished with what he was doing, he then assisted us only to have a certain “demeanor” about him. Luckily the other gentleman behind the counter stopped assisting another guests to quickly assist us with a bit of confusion. It was kind of odd standing there watching everyone seem super occupied until we were called up. Meh.\n\nOverall, this was a really good hotel and a good place to stay. Although there is room for improvement, we would definitely stay here again next time we’re in Rome. And if you made it to the end of this review, I’d recommend this place as a good place to stay to enjoy yourself and be able to relax.",

            "text": "It’s a very good, decent hotel with great rooms, noise cancellations, clean & ok bed. Pillows could be more fluffy and more comfy. However, the bed is ok.  The location of this hotel is amazing because it’s central- 15min walk from Piazza di Spagna which makes it perfect distance so you are away from the noise and crowd. The breakfast is ok - you need to pay for extras like pancakes, different type of eggs and everything which isn’t included on the menu. Huge thanks to Ariana from the breakfast for looking after us with smile and positive energy every morning. There isn’t great selection but the food is ok there. Overall it was a nice stay, however I’d give it 4 bevause realistically the prices are giving 5 star vibes but the hotel is leaning more towards 4 stars in reality.",
