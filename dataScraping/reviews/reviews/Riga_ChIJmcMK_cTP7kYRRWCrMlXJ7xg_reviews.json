Taxi they offer is a bit too expensive..better order on yourself something else:)) Hotel itself is beautiful creates lovely atmosphere.",

Room smelled a bit musty but has everything you need, balcony and spacious bathroom. Would recommend, great value for money",

My only complaint would be that the rooms' equipment is a bit old fashioned but that is not necessarily a bad thing I suppose.",

The parking situation is atrocious though, the hotel has 2 parking spots in the basement. It is crazy difficult to get your car out from there, if the other spot is occupied as well...\n\nThe reason for 1 star is that we were insulted a lot by the washing lady on our last day out of the blue. We reported this to the hotel manager via eMail and never got a response and an apology or anything. This is inacceptable",
