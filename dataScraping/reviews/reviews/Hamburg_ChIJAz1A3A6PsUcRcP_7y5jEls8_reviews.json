We got sent to the lower deck with confusion as to why I was there at the lower deck!\nEven though another table was free on the upper deck ! Unbelievable the level of discrimination and disappointment says all and I see I was not the only one there with issues concerning this. Would not recommend to others.",

            "text": "Won’t recommend to ethnically diverse people It was hardly a good experience however the 2 lovely waiters who take care of the seating at the lower deck is why I there are 2 starts and not 1. Made a reservation for a special occasion with a nice view and specially asked for this was told fine no problem. We get there a party of 4 and honestly have all gotten the  feeling of being   profiled as we were sent downstairs to sit instead of the upper deck though we specially asked for a nice view and after overlooking us a few times. Now we all saw a few tables open well on the main deck so the excuse of non being available is implausible. Being sent to the lower deck asking for an  English Menü doesn’t even compare to the German one honestly biggest disappointment ever . Then the lovey young guys at the bottom ask us why aren’t we sitting upstairs funny how we had the same question. Either way they took amazing care of us and tried to make my father’s birthday as special as they could . I wont recommend it to anyone but if you do go forget the view and support the 2 lovely gentlemen who take care of the lower deck. The shrimp is amazing and the food was clearly prepared for us really with effort.",
