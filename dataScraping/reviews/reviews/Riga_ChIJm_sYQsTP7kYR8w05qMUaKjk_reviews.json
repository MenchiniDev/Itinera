            "text": "Great location with an affordable rate! We booked two rooms, and the hotel is just a 20-minute walk from the Old Town through a lovely park, close to the embassy district. Paid parking is available (â‚¬20 per day). The staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms and bathrooms are clean, though they could use some renovation. Breakfast exceeded our expectations with a wide variety of food and delicious coffee. The only drawback was the poor sound insulation, so we could hear noise from the hallways. Overall, a pleasant stay!",
