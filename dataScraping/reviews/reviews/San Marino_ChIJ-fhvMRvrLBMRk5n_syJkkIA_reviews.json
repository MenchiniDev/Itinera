The real flaw of this restaurant, however, is the service. We entered almost like the first customers at 12.15, there were approximately 12 people in the room, 20 minutes to wait for our orders to be taken, another 20 minutes to wait for a basket of bread (requested 3 times, on the second time we were asked said that they were preparing it, they were probably going to buy it), another 20 min to have the 2 first courses. Once the first courses were finished we decided to have a very simple second course to share, it was brought to us after half an hour. In total, 2 hours passed from when we arrived to when the second one arrived.\nA waiter who prefers tables to others (people who entered after us were greeted with bread directly on the table), a second waiter who pets the dogs while bringing orders to the tables and a third waiter who continuously touches his hair during service probably that they annoy his face. Now, I ate there and I repeat, nothing to say about the food, but we really aren't there in the room. Given the previous positive reviews I hope it was just a bad day.",
