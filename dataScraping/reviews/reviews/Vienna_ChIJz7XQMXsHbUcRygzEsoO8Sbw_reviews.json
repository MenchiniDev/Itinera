Really enjoyed the breakfast and the pleasant staffs made the stay at this hotel very nice.  The warm water at the shower and bath tub were very stable with the set temp.  If I come back to Vienna again, I will definitely come back to stay here again.",

            "text": "First and foremost, I feel the staff have a difficulty being honest and clear with communication. 2 examples:\n\nWhen we checked in, we had more guests present than we initially had planned.  The staff at front desk implied that we were not allowed to have more than two people per room. When I asked them if that was a rule, they replied that it wasn't physically possible to squeeze our air mattresses into the room to accommodate our extra guests.  We paid to upgrade one room to a suite, only to discover that it was completely feasible to squeeze the extra guests into the original room.\nIn the bar they have a restaurant. The restaurant has a separate menu for food items available after 10pm, But both times I tried to order off this menu, I was met with resistance and excuses.\n\nIf you have a policy that only two people can share a regular room, then please just state that instead of lying. If you have a problem serving food after 10 pm, then please just say that instead of deflecting.\n\nThe suite we upgraded into was beautiful,  the breakfast was excellent, and the location was great for sightseeing.   But I got the impression that this hotel is operated with dishonesty.",
