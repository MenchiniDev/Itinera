I also appreciated the change in the cousine because is quite different from the previous time i've eaten here. A+ reccomanded",

Pizza base without taste. I wonder why people complain about taste but owners trying to explain that it is their taste... keep doing what you're doing and none will come back... Lady from Greece, who was serving us, was very professional and gentleman from Ukraine did care about our experience and listened to our comments, big plus. In an open kitchen there should not be people who are not up to standards and by law required to wear the right uniform. I'm disappointed to see this kitchen has no right standard.",
