The decoration is rustic, artistic, and very cozy. It smells like delicious Italian food, and you can feel your mouth starting to salivate.\nThe lady spoke great English, which for some reason seems to be hard to find in Sofia, and she showed one of the best hospitality in a long while. Very welcoming and considerate.\nThey offer a great selection of pasta and salads, and honestly, I dont think you can go wrong with anything you decide.\nThe only downside was that we went in during busy hours during the season, when most people were on holiday break, so she was the only waitress. We had to wait to order desserts, bill, drinks but none the less, you will not regret coming here. Just imagine you're in Italy where people are very chill and there is enough time in the world for everything ü§≠\nThank you for the great night, and see you soon ü©∑",

The food was so delicious and large portions. You can tell from the first bite that they use the best quality of products which is not common because not many restaurants use good quality of products but this restaurant does. The service is beyond the best. The staff really makes feel like home. The nice lady always gave great advices probably from experience. This combination of amazing food and great service is not easy to find. The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food and the service. I really enjoyed and recommend this restaurant to everyone.",
