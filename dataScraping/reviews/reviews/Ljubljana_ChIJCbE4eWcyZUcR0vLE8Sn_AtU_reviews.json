We asked to pay separatelly 4 times, they said yes but then made as pay all together. We spent 5 minuted waiting standin still just to pay because only one waiter knew how to use the card reader. The food came in small portions: few calamari of mid quality, with a gum-like consistence for 14‚Ç¨. The craziest thing was the price of water: 5‚Ç¨ for 1L, ARE YOU SERIOUS? They also served us sparkling water, but we asked for still water. Overall, prices were too high for the food quality and quantity, also considering that the wiater service was bad. Would not recomend.",

You have to try beer made of chestnut honey - absolute winner. You can also take beer home with you, they sell it on site. Will have more pictures soon but highly recommend this place. Prices are reasonable",
