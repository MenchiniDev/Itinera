Tons of options to get things you need or didn't need but you buy it anyway.  The outdoor produce market with side bars is the fun part.  Otherwise, a mall is a mall is a mall.  Convenience in the traditional box stores inside an air con building.  Nothing new here but you know this already going in.",
