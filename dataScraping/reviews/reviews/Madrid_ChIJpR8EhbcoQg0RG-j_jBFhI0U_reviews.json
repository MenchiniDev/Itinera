This is the first greek restaurant Iâ€™ve tried in Madrid, therefore it is not very easy to benchmark it. Even though the food did not feel purely same as in Greece, it was good enough I believe. The service was good, prices were OK. In conclusion Milos is a good option to try greek food.",

It has everything that a Greek cousin can offer, depending on the area of Milos.\nGood atmosphere, they have improved the acoustic and now is much more calm. I have been there 3 times in las 6 months. That is a lot for a person who travels for work.",
