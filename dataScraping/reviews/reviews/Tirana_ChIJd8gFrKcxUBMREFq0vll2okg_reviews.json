He was sitting in the dark in the lobby.   He didn't have time to stop playing on his phone long enough to assist me.  Never stood up until I pressed the taxi issue and insisted he call.  He argued with me that I was early for my taxi, when I told him I needed one.   I struggled out the door with my bags, and he never got up to help.",

Things that I didn't like:\n-Ancient air conditioning that barely worked, also it seemed like it hasn't been cleaned for a while\n-Neon lamps that were in front of my room. They were flashing and making it impossible to sleep without the curtains on.\n\nOverall, nice place, but with some negligible problems that can be fixed.",
