            "text": "An EXCELLENT value for money üëç Great breakfast and great service! Way to go!\n\n1. The hotel is situated conveniently in 2 minutes from a tram station. At first we had a doubt that it would be far from the city center but it took up to 30 min of pretty picturesque way to get there.\n2. The breakfast is a true Swedish buffet, lots of everything and no hurry.\n3. The staff is very attentive, especially Alva who answered the email with the special request and found us the best room in the category. So grateful!\n4. It‚Äôs clean and quiet and the curtains don‚Äôt let the light to disturb your sleep.\n5. The room is very good with the superb panoramic view of Stockholm. Also, a very comfy area around the window for 2 people. Unforgettable experience.\n\nThe halls are a bit simplistic. And there was no fridge in our room. Also the clean up during breakfast could be better in the tables and faster in the breakfast stations.\n\nSuch a nice place to stay in Stockholm!",

The restaurant for dinner has excellent food and service. The front desk employees are friendly and helpful. They will go out of their way to help you.  The room service came at different tines to clean the room. I look forward to staying here again on my next visit.",
