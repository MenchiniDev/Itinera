Prices are way too high for a standard cinema: 16 euros (with students discount) for a ticket and a small-size bucket of popcorns. The sound in the hall is too loud. People working there are very nice, but this doesn't compensate the stale popcorns.",

Can you believe any theatre in the world doing that ? They had one job. Really spoilt the entire experience for us. I've been waiting for this movie for so many months and they do this. Gosh. Its a terrible terrible mistake, and they can never undo it for us.",
