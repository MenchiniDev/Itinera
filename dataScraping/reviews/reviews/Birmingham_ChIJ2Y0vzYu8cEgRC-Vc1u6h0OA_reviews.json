            "text": "Had a solo visit to Birmingham last weekend and staying at this hotel was such a great experience. The check-in and out were seamless thanks to Hanin for helpful assistance. The room was clean and tidy, and place was quiet too. Apart from the noise due to work which was done above my room that lasted an hour during the day. The location was at the heart of the city centre with many options from restaurants to attractions. I don’t travel that often but having an experience like this makes me want to go out more.",

            "text": "It’s very disappointing to say the least. I checked into Room 1*** on 4th November, and the experience has been poor from start to finish. I complained multiple times at reception, asking them to change the bedsheets, but nothing was done. Every time, they assured me my request was “noted,” yet over my three-day stay, the sheets were never changed.\n\nThe carpet looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages, with visible stains that could even be pet mess. While the bathroom was clean on my first day, it was completely neglected after that. I even found my own hair left in the shower from the day before – absolutely unacceptable.\n\nI don’t understand why cleanliness isn’t a priority here. I wouldn’t waste my money on this experience again – not what you’d expect from a 4-star hotel in Birmingham City Centre.",

The only thing that was bad was when we went to book the rooms, the person on reception told us we had to book it through booking.com.\nWith booking it through there it meant we didn't get the breakfast, which is included when you book directly.\nRooms were lovely and the hotel is nice.",
