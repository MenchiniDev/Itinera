            "text": "UPDATE: I have returned a few times, most recently now in the middle of November 2023. The standards seem to have been upheld and the food and service are still excellent. Today I had a special pizza topped with slices of mortadella and a hearty amount of burrata, and it was easily one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I had a pasta dish that was also a special, a pesto sauce with bacon and other ingredients I've forgotten; my only regret was that I wasn't hungry enough to eat more than half of it. I'll continue to offer Il Giardino as one of the best Italian restaurants in the area.\n\nFor starters, I arrived close enough to closing time that I would not have been upset if the staff had told me I couldn't eat there; however they still sat me and provided good service.\n\nI had the seared tuna, and it was excellent. In fact I probably could've stopped there; it was cooked perfectly (still rare), seasoned just enough, and quality of the fish was decent.\n\nI also ordered the Pugliese-style pizza, which was very good and cooked the right way. I may stop back for lunch one day before the end of this trip just to get another pizza.\n\nThe wine selection is broad yet chiefly Italian; my bottle kept me occupied throughout the meal. It was going to be my dessert as well, but the waiter wore me down and I had their tiramisu. As it should be, it was relatively light and not excessively sweet.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, and I'd recommend to those looking for fairly authentic Italian food.",

Waiting time kills a little the dinning experience never the less, loveee their seafood pasta (made with fresh pasta) and their pizzas.",
