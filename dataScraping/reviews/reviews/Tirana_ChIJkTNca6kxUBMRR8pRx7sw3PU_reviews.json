A little out of the centre, which we had hoped meant it would be quieter but the soundproofing was poor. We could hear the lift and the pool from our room - even when the pool was closed in the middle of the night. Staff were great and bed was comfortable. Stay here but bring earplugs.",

The rooms are clean, spacious and well-equipped with i.e. airco.\n\nBesides the great breakfast -not over-complicated but good quality- and rooftop bar, the one thing that stood out to me was the service. The reception helped us with all of our questions and needs. Would definitely recommend visiting this hotel.",

However, the fact that they close the pool at 18:00 is a shame. Being a city hotel, where the temperature during the summer is high even later in the afternoon, itâ€™s a shame not being able to go for a dip after having walked around the city. Also, in the bar of the pool, the indoors part of the bar, people smoke inside. Quite disgusting. Overall a great experience except for those two things.",
