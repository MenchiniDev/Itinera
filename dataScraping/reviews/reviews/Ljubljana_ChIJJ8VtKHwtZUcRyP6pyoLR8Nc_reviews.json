Big menu, all vegetarian with vegan options.\nA mix of meat substitute (eg seitan steak) and vegetable based dishes. Really enjoyed the dodoli tris, and my friend enjoyed the mushroom gnocchi. Very friendly and attentive waiters, despite every table being full.\nWe tried the layer cake too, Potica, which was very nice, not what I expected but I liked it!",
