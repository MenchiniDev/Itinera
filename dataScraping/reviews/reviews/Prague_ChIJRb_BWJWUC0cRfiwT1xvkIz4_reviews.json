            "text": "Well located. Hotel is excellent art deco building and very nice to walk around public areas and restaurant to see the decor. Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Be prepared for lobby / bar to be busy - this appears to be partnered with several river tours who start/finish in Prague. Almost every day there was a at least one tour operator setting up table in lobby (sometimes 2) to manage large groups. Breakfast was good, although service was variable. For example, first day we were asked if wanted coffees as soon as we sat and these were barista made / table service, the next day weâ€™re told to go to self service automatic machine.",

The rooms were immaculately clean, with a very comfortable bed and high end toiletries in the en-suite. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",

It had a  comfortable king size bed, more than enough storage space, a bathroom stocked with all the bells and whistles, slippers, robes, etc.\n\nWe ordered room service, the food was excellent and not overpriced (which is not the case in most hotels) the staff were friendly and really professional.\n\nBreakfast was the highlight, simply because the restaurant is a work of art! That being said the food was varied and plentiful and (once again) the staff were amazing.",

            "text": "One of the most amazing hotels I've ever stayed in. Not because it is the most luxurious - though it is *very* well appointed, with tall ceilings, spacious rooms, a giant bathroom (separate toilet room in my case), high thread counts, etc. - but because the hotel has PRESENCE. It has been impeccably and lovingly maintained (and modernized) since it's Art Deco heyday birth around 100 years ago. The design is gorgeous, but it doesn't feel one bit \"old\" in the rundown or \"seen better days\" sense. Just a fantastic place.\nStaff also top notch, restaurant very good as well. I have not a single bad thing to say about this hotel.",

Cafe Imperial is also historic and a beautiful environment for breakfast. Kind and friendly staff, good location still very central but in a slightly quieter area away from the bars and clubs.",
