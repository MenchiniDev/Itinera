From that moment on I left the food they brought me without trying.  How disgusting!  The waiters... not ideal either.  They seem stressed.  Surely exploited with so much work and poor pay. Not recommended at all. This is the most expensive neighborhood in Madrid, sure you can find another place to eat without cockroaches.",

A bit strange for a big bar with terrace  in the posh area of Madrid.\nThe second waiter was much better.\nPricey, but normal for the area",

            "text": "Awful place. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Ordered a steak which arrived ice cold and had to send it back. I then ordered cod which came plain raw, also had to be sent back. When the fish came back it was covered in very fatty additional oils. Ordered tap water and the waiter told me that if I didn't want to pay for a bottle of water, to go to the bar and get it myself. Lastly, when paying, we split the bill 3 ways and one of my friends did the maths wrong so we overpaid 9 euros. A minute later we realised we had been overcharged (the waiter had done the maths on his phone and knew full well we were overpaying), asked kindly if we could get a refund for the overpayment and got told by the waiter \"I am fed up, I am not giving you a refund. Your problem.\". Super stingy place, awful service from start to finish and food quality was awful. I felt like Gordon Ramsey visiting a low standard restaurant with nonedible food and sending it back to the kitchen.",
