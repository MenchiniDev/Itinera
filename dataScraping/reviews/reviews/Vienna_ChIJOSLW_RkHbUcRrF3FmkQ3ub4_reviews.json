You can walk to the subway station in less than 5 minutes and can reach major spots easily. The staff was friendly.  Overall, I had a really good experience here.",

            "text": "A wonderful stay! We stayed at the Bassena in July 2024 and loved every second of it. The rooms were comfortable, clean and welcoming. Very quiet with zero sound from both outside and adjoining rooms. Up to date television with the option to add your personal device and stream- would welcome a few more English speaking channels on the TV, but that's a personal preference!\n\nWe did encounter an issue with our first room, where the air conditioner wasn't working at full power (needed as it was low 30Â°Cs every day!). However the staff were brilliant and gave us a room on the same floor, so we could just swap over. Brilliant service!\n\nThe location was perfect for us (young couple). We wanted somewhere outside of the main historic city, but still close to transport and the Patter! Direct train to the airport as well, we couldn't have chosen a better location!\n\nWould stay here again in a heartbeat and would recommend this to anyone willing to visit Vienna!",

The room is very clean and well equipped. Good beds, blackout and soundproofing, a coffee machine, a refrigerator and a kettle in the room. We arrived an hour early, the room was ready and we were checked in early without additional charges. At the reception when checking in, they saw that it was my birthday and gave me 2 drinks. Special thanks for the help to the receptionist Margo. High recommend!)",
