There was no air conditioning and if I opened the window, it was like I was in the Bar and if I shut the window, you could still hear every word!\n\nI was there for business and had been since 4am so really needed a good and early sleep!\n\nI asked to move rooms and was told it was fully booked and to take some earplugs.\n\nBed was comfortable, breakfast was nice but please, ensure you face the courtyard if you need to sleep!!",

After stating months in advance some necessary accommodations due to medical reasons, that weren’t met, my family was willing to pay for the difference in price, but the staff refused to work with us, even though we could see other rooms available on the booking site, making difficult to even meet in the middle. It left my family no other choice, but to try to find a different hotel that was willing to work with us.",
