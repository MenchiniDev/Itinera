The staff are exceptionally friendly and professional.\n\nThe breakfast on offer everyday is beyond outstanding. The selection is the absolute best we have ever encountered anywhere in the world.\n\nThe location is perfect. It's close to every form of transport you will need. Furthermore, the rooms are quiet, you can hardly hear anything.",

Another big downside is that you have to book your breakfast time in advance (never seen that before). We ended up setting our alarm to be able to go down for breakfast. Not something you want on holidays.",

However, the walls seem to be quite thin, so things were not always silent.\nMonsoon showers are always good, and the breakfast buffet was extensive, but the centralised heating was still stuck on summer mode at the end of September, which made the room quite cold\nEasy walk from the railway station and bus terminal",
