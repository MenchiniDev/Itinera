            "text": "We went out for dinner with the family on a Friday evening. The cakes are good, and we had mulled wine alongside. The layout of the space is a bit odd, as some tables are uncomfortably placed in the middle of the room. If you can get a table or a seat by the window or along the wall, itâ€™s quite cozy. When itâ€™s busy, having just one server at the counter is insufficient, leading to long waiting times and queues. Otherwise, itâ€™s a pretty decent place.",

Weâ€™ve been here several times, and while the coffee has consistently been really good, the pastries, cakes, and croissants were just okayâ€”nothing particularly special.\nItâ€™s usually very busy, and thereâ€™s almost always a queue to place an order. Interestingly, we only found it empty once when we visited in the evening.\nOverall, itâ€™s worth a visit for the coffee and the historic atmosphere.",

But despite the fact that it looks so luxurious and well, expensive, it's actually just a very nice, friendly cafe with delicious sweets and good coffee. There are a lot od tourists taking pictures, so it's not a good place to sit back and relax. It's rather crowded and you're expected to eat and leave the table for next clients. There is also a shop with marzipan in different flavours, nice to buy for a gift or for yourself ðŸ™‚",
