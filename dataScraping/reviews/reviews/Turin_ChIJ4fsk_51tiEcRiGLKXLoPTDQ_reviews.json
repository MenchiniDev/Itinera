But…\n\nIf you are considering to order meal to hotel - think twice. I did not see any poster that “you CAN’T eat in room”. So I had to finish my pizza outdoors ok street.\n\nThere are no tables for such situations - you can choose between sitting on the street or find some kind of improvised shelf.",

Staff are extremely helpful.  One thing to note - the hotel is an historic building and there are no lifts. We're glad we decided to have dinner at the hotel because the food was very good and gave us a few ideas to attempt at home. The restaurant has a serious cheese board that is highly recommended.",

The area is very close to that enormous Saturday flea market, so don't plan on sleeping in on Saturday morning. We had a lovely visit. Not the nicest part of town, but it was perfectly fine, Italy isn't scary.",
