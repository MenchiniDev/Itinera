Our room was spacious and charming with outdoor access (and the welcome gifts were extremely thoughtful).  We were automatically, without asking, allowed to check in early and have access to our room.  The meal was excellent and the service was five star.  My only complaint was that we were unable to stay longer than what we could.  The stay was so special and helped make San Marino the highlight of this trip.",

One of my highlights was their truffle pasta and the choice of desserts most of them I never tried before. The staff were very attentive and came up with some great wine and cheese recommendations.",

            "text": "Amazing food!! Everything we had was delightful. We are both vegetarian and it’s so nice finding amazing stuffed pasta without meat- the tortelloni with truffle I could eat everyday! They also are crustacean free which for someone like me with an allergy was a great find!\n\nStaff was great and fun!\n\nIt gets much busier later around 8/8:30 so if you want to get in and out quickly then come earlier- otherwise enjoy the awesome cave atmosphere and more wine!",
