Mango sauce is sweet to the taste like it came from juice and the fajita chicken was over salted. Overall, the food is not authentic and could use some improvement on the culinary side. Other than that, the service & vibe is great.",

Unfortunately they didn't have any fruity margaritas when we visited, which is a shame, but the traditional one was really good either way.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing. The place is really well decorated and there aren't many people during weekdays.\n\nAs for taste, it's slightly above average. The ribs basically fell apart by themselves and the sauce was nice. The margarita and the lemonade tasted great too.",

The tortilla at multiple places was uncooked and thick. Filling was tasteless . Please avoid !! What else can you expect from a place which says  - the client  is always wrong",

Instead of a chili sauce, the enchiladas were served with a tomato sauce. The small side of beans were sweet, and had an unusual spice.\n\nThe photos were Mexican and nicely displayed.",
