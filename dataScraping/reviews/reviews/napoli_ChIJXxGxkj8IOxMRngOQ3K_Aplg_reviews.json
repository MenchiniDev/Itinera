Walk in, sit down, order your pizza and drinks, enjoy, ask for your check, pay at the register on your way out. Easy. There was no line. No wait. I hard from another traveler on my cruise that this restaurant is recommended by Rick Steves. Did I say air conditioning?",

I had the traditional neopolitan with buffalo mozzarella. My husband had the mushroom\nand prosciutto. Both were delicious but we wish there was a little more basil. We appreciated being able to sit in the air conditioned place and the no wait!",

The wait is worth it because of how good the food is. The pizzas are very large, we ordered one each and had difficulty finishing it, might want to consider sharing two pizzas between three people.",
