Don't expect the food to be anywhere close to authentic, I found food to be bit alien myself, the owner herself told me its not authentic and made to the tastes of locals. While chana masala is ok, gobi manchurian is utter disappointment. Its mostly takeout and they just have few chairs to sit down if you want to eat here, but they have no restrooms.",

The garlic naan bread was great! The interior is cute and you can people-watch, but there aren’t many chairs. The music was great.",

            "text": "It’s good Indian restaurant but a bit overpriced, might be due to Iceland don’t know, limited seating capacity so will have to take out if more than 3-4persons, no other options left.\nIt’s 800-900 meters away from bus stop no. 10-12. Taste of the food was better. It’s good to carry local currency for the payment to avoid extra card transactions. Service was good. Cost for 2 person dining would be approx 4200+ isk (min).",

All the food was very flavorful and the variety forced me to try new things that I wouldn't have on my own. The outside of the restaurant looks a bit scary with some graffiti on the windows and such, but the inside was clean and cozy, if maybe a bit small. I think the restaurant might be popular with the locals for carryout as there were only about 4 tables inside. Overall, I would definitely go back!",
