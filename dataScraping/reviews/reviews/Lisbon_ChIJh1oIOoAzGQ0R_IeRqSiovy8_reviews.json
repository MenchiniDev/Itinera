It started with the Ginjinha Sour cocktail (with chocolate) & Caipirinha, then Peixinhos da Hort (beans), crispy chicken, and black pork, as a desert choclate tart. The atmosphere is relaxed, the service is attentive, and the food is exceptionally well-prepared and delicious. The price-performance ratio is very good. Thank you for the wonderful dinner.",

Also a very big fan of the fried chicken (prob one of the best I’ve ever tasted anywhere) and the lamb! The dessert we got (compressed cucumber & merengue) was kind of weird on paper, but when we tasted it, we were so pleased with how good it tasted and how well the ingredients worked together.\n\nYou definitely have to make a reservation though - we went on a weeknight and it was still super crowded!",

In my opinion, with a prior reservation, you should give the best tables.\nHowever, we were served by a very pleasant girl who managed to negotiate with their unpleasant manager to move us outside.\nThe food is very interesting and tasty",
