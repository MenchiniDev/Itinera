            "text": "First of all let me write about the owner & care taker Mr. Maurice, he was no nice guy and dropped my at the historical center as there were no buses at that time. Thank you Mr. Maurice for your gesture.\n\nThis is only hostel in the country of San Marino, when I checked in I was all alone in a big room. The stay is okay for the price you may have to pay additional €3 or 4 for the linen and towels. A bit of light arrangements down floor may change the impact of this hostel.\n\nThe historic center is 4 km away and the buses are from 08:10 until 07:25 if I’m not wrong and running every 1.5 hours.\n\nHad a good stay for the price",

They also gave me maps and guided me on the bus timings which was kind. Only problem was they dont give you any supplies like soap or shampoo sachets as hotels usually do. Good thing there is a supermarket nearby but mostly at the checkin time it closes (7:45). Not complaining but everyone booking this hotel should take their own soap with them. And other things ofcourse.",
