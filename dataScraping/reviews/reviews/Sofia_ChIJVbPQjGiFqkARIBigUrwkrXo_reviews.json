The parking area is very small and there were no place to park (if you pay additional 8 Euros, they forward you to somewhere for parking ). The kids were overslept in the car. While carrying them and luggages, He was not in any help. The rooms were so small for 2 adults and 2 kids. It is just standard clean, the floors are covered by carpets! The bathroom needs updating. The breakfast was just reaching standards. Definitely not a 4 star Hotel!",
