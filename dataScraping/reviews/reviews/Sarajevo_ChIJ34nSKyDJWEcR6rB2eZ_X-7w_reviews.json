I must say, this place is excellent.  The food was authentic and the ambience was super.  Best part was that this place is halal ðŸ’¯- kudos to the owner brother Izmir for keeping this place halal.\n\nWeâ€™ll definitely be back when weâ€™re in Sarajevo next time round.",

It's good! Don't get me wrong, but nothing too amazing.\n\nThe restaurant itself is not too expensive but the waiters are polite and there's plenty off peeps at all times here.\n\nThe delivery time is approx. 15-30 minutes for car delivery but in the restaurant it's about 20 minutes.\n\nThe ambient is relaxing and there's no alchoholic drinks derved here.\n\nIf you need a quick bite or to go somewhere for a group lunch or dinner then this is the place for you!",
