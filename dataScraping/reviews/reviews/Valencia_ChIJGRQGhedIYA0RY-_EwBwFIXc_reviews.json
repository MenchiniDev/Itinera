With its modern architecture and spacious layout, it provides a lively atmosphere for shopping and leisure, making it a popular destination for both locals and visitors.\n\n28/10/2024 - Update after company reply:\nFirst of all, it seems your perception about reviews is a bit mistaken. Reviews are not a request for assistance and don't require an answer. Reviews are just an opinion about the company.\nFurthermore, who said to you that my review was not written by a customer? And if it was really not written by a customer, what's the point? It's the most ridiculous reply I ever got. I'm praising the company and they come to question my review with unfounded claims.",
