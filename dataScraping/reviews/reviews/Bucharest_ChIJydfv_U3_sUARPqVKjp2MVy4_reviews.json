No terminals to make an order, so you have to read from a screen above the cash desk, which is extremely uncomfortable. Staff just don't care at all, and didn't even apologize for such service. Also, what I got doesn't look right, at least the amount of sauce - a few days ago the amount of sauce was at least 2 times bigger. On a picture you see large fries + sauce 25g-21ml (3 LEI for this amount of sauce?) I like KFC, but recommend to avoid this particular place at all costs.",
