Though the restaurant was full of guests ,the service was impeccable and thank you to Raoul for looking after us. We saw some fadistas such as Elsa Laboreiro and Ana Matar.",

Every time they sing 3 songs and then they have a break to let people enjoy their dinner. The only frustrating thing was other guests who could not manage to shut up for 9 minutes at a time. However, that is not that fault of the venue who do their best to remind people to be quiet. Overall we had a lovely night.",

It was way overpriced, I ordered the Luso Style Steak on the menu and it was almost completely raw when it came, we then sent it back and when it came back it was still raw.They didn't comp it or even apologized. The waiter also asked for a tip at the end which was insultingly uncomfortable. The ambience was fine, they do ask for silence during performance and they turn the lights down pretty low where it's almost hard to see your own food. I do not recommend bringing anyone under 12.",
