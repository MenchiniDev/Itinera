The included breakfast was extremely basic and they told us it was worth “30€ per person” but it was far from it. Trays almost always empty even at an early hour.\nFor the price we expected a more top experience, but it’s like an ibis at most. Great location and very clean.",

Great lighting, big windows, comfy bed, and ample storage.\n\nThe separated bathrooms are single bathrooms, not dorm style, which is great.\n\nAs all others have said, breakfast is great.",
