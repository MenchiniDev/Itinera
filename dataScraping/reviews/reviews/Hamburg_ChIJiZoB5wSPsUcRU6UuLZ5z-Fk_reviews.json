I ordered the Schnitzel and yes it’s very large BUT, it comes with no sauce which means it’s very dry. It has no salt and mine was overdone and it’s chicken so you can imagine how I had to chew. It really wasn’t worth it.\nThe staff was friendly.\nDespite giving extremely large portions, they don’t have take away boxes and gave us a piece of foil to wrap our food in.",

Very friendly staff, they found us a table for an hour even without a reservation. I ordered the drumsticks with apple sauce, an unusual combination, but it was tasty, a good size portion. I think it's a great place for a company of friends or a date.",
