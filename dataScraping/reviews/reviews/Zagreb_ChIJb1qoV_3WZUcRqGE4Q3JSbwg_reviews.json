There are unique connections with certain items, and various relationship with loved ones (or things).\n\nIt is nice to visit if you are in Zagreb, it is close to many of the other attractions, so make sure to give it a stop.\n\nThe museum is a bit tight, so it is recommended to come at a less crowded time.",

It's a nice activity if you are in a romantic mood but not sure it's worth 7€. I would recommend a visit , only if you have free time in Zagreb. Don't prioritise it .",

It’s made up of memorabilia from people that have experienced broken relationships, including small stories about what happened. Be prepared to get in your feelings there’s some pretty deep stories here. There’s also a coffee shop attached to the museum if you want a drink and small snack. I would definitely recommend checking it out when coming to Zagreb.",

This is a very different type of museum, interestingly crowdsourced. Few stories were heartbreaking to read while few would lighten your mood up and encourage to come out of shitty relations. Go visit this one in Zagreb- it will take an hour but feel good and different.",
