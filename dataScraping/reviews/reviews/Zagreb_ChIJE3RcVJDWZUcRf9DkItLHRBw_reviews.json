One of the side sauces was ranch? and there was no pico de gallo? There was probably a bit too much cheese (I think I used maybe half, really trying to use it) and just some side lettuce (no tomato or pico as mentioned).\nOverall the food was good but very different from what I normally would expect.",

At the end of the day we had lots of fun, the decoration is original and really nice.\n\nI was not really impressed with the dessert menu , so if you are going there for mostly dessert you will probably be disappointed.\n\nFood was good and service was Ok, nothing really special.",

It was sheer reason why I stopped here. I lived in Mexico and I even took cooking class chilaquiles was my favorite dish, chilaquiles served by this restaurant has nothing to the with original thing - here it is just a casserole with bits of tortilla a lot of cheese (mozzarella?) and some corn - once again nothing to do with real thing. Please ask your cook to see what chilaquiles is üôèüèº or take it from your menu üõë.",
