            "text": "Classic French food in a nice part of Oslo. We had a 3 course with a cured meat platter, duck for main, and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e for dessert. The food was well prepared and presented, but perhaps a bit rich for me (not a problem if you have a big appetite!).\n\nThe noise level wasnâ€™t great. We were on the second floor and it was difficult to speak with the person across the table without shouting.\n\nServers were efficient and friendly. Itâ€™s a nice restaurant for a more formal dinner, though is probably pick a more quiet time of the day if I came back.",
