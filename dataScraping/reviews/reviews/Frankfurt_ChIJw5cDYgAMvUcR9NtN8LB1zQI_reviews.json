Respect for that and generally every thing.I will come back for sure",

            "text": "Rooms are modern and clean despite us booking a room with a fireplace and not getting a room with a fireplace. I would recommend to NOT go here as it‘s nothing but a trap. We ordered room service twice. A lobster burger is 54 (!) euros, as everything off their food menu is overprized. I asked to have the lobster burger without onions and of course they brought it with onions. Like who has the audacity to charge 54€ for a single burger without sides and then get the order wrong. Will certainly not come back",

            "text": "I had a terrible experience at Roomers Frankfurt. While the hotel manager eventually intervened and resolved my issue, it was frustrating to have to escalate matters to that level. The rooms, although stylish, are outdated and show signs of wear. I noticed cracks, grated furniture, and stain marks throughout my stay, which was disappointing given the hotel's reputation.\n\nThe worst part of my experience was with the receptionist. I can’t recall her name, but her lack of professionalism was striking. It made the check-in process unnecessarily stressful and set a negative tone for my stay.\n\nI do want to thank the polite and professional hotel manager for stepping in to help, but one positive interaction doesn’t outweigh the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, I won’t be staying at Roomers Frankfurt again. There are better options in the area that offer both style and quality service.",
