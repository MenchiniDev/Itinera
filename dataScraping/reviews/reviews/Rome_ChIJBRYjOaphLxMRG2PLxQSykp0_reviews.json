            "text": "This hotel deserves 5 stars. It has luxury European style with amazing marble floor and walls.\nI stayed in suite with view of main street in Feb 2020. I am rating it at four seasons hotel level. Well deserved!\nThe hotel location is amazing walking distance to all hot touristic spots. Even shuttle bus to Castle Romano outlet is steps away.\nTheir lift is very antique and unique it reminds me of old style lifts.\nBF was very good with different choices.",

But, the food in the dining room was excellent.\nWith all that said, some very expensive jewelry was taken from our room. Of course, management said they were not responsible plus they said I should have known sooner that it was missing. Not to wait til I returned home.",
