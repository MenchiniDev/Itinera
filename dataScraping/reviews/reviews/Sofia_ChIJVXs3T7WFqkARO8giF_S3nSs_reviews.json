            "text": "I visited yesterday being the Chuseok holiday in Korea, and naturally there was a gathering of Koreans in the restaurant which made it fun with warm greetings and children playing around.\n\nThe chef was nice enough to offer service dishes to celebrate the holiday. The staff that attended to me were super nice and jolly and were absolutely professional.\n\nNow to the food - having been to another Korean restaurant in Sofia, I can tell for sure that this may be the best one out here (you'll see evidence from the photos) at an even better price! Tasty and delicious and staying true to the authentic Korean cuisine. The chef is just amazing and despite the distance from the city centre, I'll be visiting again just to have another taste!\n\nBus 88 from Paradise Center towards Druzhba 3 will take you few minutes close to the restaurant. Or the metro, stop at Jolio Curie and walk down the road from the German embassy and down the street. The restaurant is in a very quiet area, but you'll find it easily with your map.",

The waiter was super friendly and if you ask they can make some dishes one idea less spicy. We came mainly to try the kimchi but at the end we ordered a lot of things and we were very delighted! I would definitely recommend the rice wine, itâ€™s very aromatic and not that alcoholic.",

The rice was a bit overcooked so maybe a little less time would be great. Also if they change the music somehow is going to be an upgrade, because it doesn't match the type of food and the place. I liked how it wasn't way too spicy and the menu showed us what's less and what's spicier.  I will personally visit this place again.",
