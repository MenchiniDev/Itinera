Restaurant was very tidy, setup is simple and very polite service with fluent English speakers.\nI wanted to try something spicy in taste so I opted to order a chicken vindaloo with basmati rice and we also ordered a daily special which was a lamb sauce, along rice and vegetables. Both meals were great in taste and overall it was a satisfactory experience.\nAitah Elevant !",
