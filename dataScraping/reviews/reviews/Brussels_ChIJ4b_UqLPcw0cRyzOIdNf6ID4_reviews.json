Rooms were nice and clean, bathroom super clean with hot water. The second time we stayed, we decided to have buffet breakfast and it was excellent. Lots of variety to choose from and fresh.The breakfast was made even more special with a great waiter called Kamal. He was very welcoming, friendly and went beyond for one of the customers sitting on the other table. She asked if there was lime and he said they didnâ€™t have any but went and quickly both a few limes and sliced it for her and added to buffet. I was so impressed. He then offered us to try their new cake  that they will be serving which was so delicious. Thank you Kamal and all the team. Gary and Meli from Australia",
