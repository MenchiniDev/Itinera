            "text": "Hello , I spent two nights in this hotel, it was very warm, not noisy, the room was in good condition. The only negative is that the hotel is empty, I was alone and it was a little scary. And I constantly had to go down from the 8th floor back to the reception because my key card didn’t work.\nIf you need an iron or a toothbrush with toothpaste, ask at the reception.\nI was allowed to leave my luggage in a certain place when my reservation ended and I needed to leave without luggage.\nSo I can say this is a good 4 stars for the hotel",

Clean rooms with TV, fridge, small balcony, good shower and helpful staff, supermarket across the road. Breakfast is basic but enough to keep you full until the afternoon. Thanks again - I’ll definitely be back!",

I had a narrow room to the street front, the bulvardul hasn't roared too much at night. Traffic decreases. I found 3 and a half tables for all my tiny things and 2 chairs, good lighting. Good bed! Everything worked except for the a/c which had a hit, but did the job.\nNice breakfast buffet with assistance of several waiters.\nStaff was very friendly and helpful. All at an affordable rate.",
