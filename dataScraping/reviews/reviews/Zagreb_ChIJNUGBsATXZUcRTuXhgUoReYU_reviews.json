            "text": "Overall a great place with a great menu, tasty food, decent service, and a great atmosphere. Very well shaded outdoor section and stylish interior.  Food was good, but the Soba noodles with duck, while very tasty, was a bit too salty. They should significantly reduce the sodium content, perhaps by cutting the amount of soy sauce they use by 75% and allow the customer to add soy sauce as they like, since it is already on the table. It was very salty, but still good. The chicken salad was very good. The chicken spring rolls were much more like chicken croquettes with minced meat and breadcrumbs, not with the usual crispy / crunchy spring roll dough you might find at a more traditional Asian restaurant. They tasted ok, but they really aren‚Äôt ‚Äúspring rolls‚Äù.  I would suggest renaming this dish as ‚ÄúAsian chicken croquettes‚Äù.  The crispy tuna roll was good, but rather small (4 pieces) and also not very crispy. The atmosphere and music was really great and our waiter was kind. A bit expensive compared with other nearby restaurants, but overall a nice experience. I would definitely go back, but I would order differently.",

For parents, important to know it is not child friendly at night. Inside is a night club at night after one point with club music. It is easy to continue your night inside at the bar after your dinner. It is located in the heart of the city so you can explore the city earlier and continue dining and clubbing there.",
