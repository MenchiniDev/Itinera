We had great service from all of the staff, and the food was awesome! Everything from the spinach and chick peas, to the bacalau and cuttlefish was super flavorful! The jamon and queso plate was also great! Awesome all around experience!",

Service is good but spoiled by the hawkers and vendors who attempt to force you to buy stuff while you are eating. Skip and go somewhere less tourist oriented.",
