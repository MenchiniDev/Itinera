Service extremely slow but nice. They probably tried to do their best that night but they didn't succeed with any table. It's a pity!",

Unexpectedly the restaurant was quiet at Thursday 6PM but we still had to wait for quite long. Great taste was more than worth of waiting. Perhaps they need one more chef?",
