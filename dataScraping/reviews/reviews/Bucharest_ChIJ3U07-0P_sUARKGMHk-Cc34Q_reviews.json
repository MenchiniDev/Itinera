It was very nice and atmospheric.\n\nOur waiter (a young blond guy) was very nice. He gave advices about some dishes as we couldn’t choose. He was very kind and smiley.\n\nWe took 3 different meat dishes and all of them were very good and tasty. The meat was tender; the apple strudel - fine.\n\nNice place, no bad vibes",

The food was good, and the service was quick. One small detail to note: if you order a glass of a specific wine, it would be better if the waiters brought the bottle to the table to pour the wine, rather than taking the glass away and returning with it already served.",

Our waiter was very attentive and extremely friendly and helpful. We had the fried chicken steamed with potato wedges and garlic, the pork ribs with polenta and the grilled chicken with potatoes. All food was delivered promptly and the flavours were fantastic. If you love garlic and traditional Romanian food, this is a stop that should not be missed. I would definitely return the next time I'm in the area.",
