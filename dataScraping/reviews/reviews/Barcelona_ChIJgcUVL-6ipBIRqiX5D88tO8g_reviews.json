            "text": "The hotel is located in the center in the heart of things and is really beautifully designed, a boutique hotel that has an old elevator that has been renovated and is even operational. The reception, the restaurant, and the terrace area with the pool are nicely decorated.\nThe staff is very kind, especially at breakfast. When we arrived the first morning, Vanessa talked to the children and realized that we were celebrating my daughter 3rd birthday, she arrived with a brownie and a candle and together with the employees sang her birthday.\nThe breakfast is very rich, there is everything from everything, fresh pastries, fruits, vegetables, eggs, cheeses, sausages, juices, coffee and all types of milk and substitutes. And even a gluten-free menu placed on all the tables (impressive) there is an option to order eggs in the preferred style or pancakes (which the children ordered every morning) for the table. We also ordered room service, the food arrived and was delicious and so was the sangria üíÉüèΩ\nIn terms of cleanliness, everything was good, there was always a pleasant smell in the hotel and in the corridors. Clean towels were brought every day, but by the third day the room was already really dusty, so it's obvious that they don't vacuum every day.\nThe rooms are spacious and equipped with all kinds of fun kits and soaps. And the bunk bed was a hit and my daughter enjoyed climbing :)\nOverall a great hotel I would recommend to families as well as couples",

So nice to be in a foreign country and get the best recommendations! The manager was very kind and checked in on us to see how we were doing, I broke my toe and the girls in the bar gave me ice.\nI loved the morning breakfast ! They really have everything! Stay for the breakfast eat dinner out!",
