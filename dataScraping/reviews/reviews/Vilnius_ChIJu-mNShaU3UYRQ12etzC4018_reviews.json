I saw a lot of good reviews and beautiful photos online, but in reality: the room is very cold (heating didn’t work, we had to ask for radiator), the cleanliness of the room isn’t the best (hair in bed and in the bathroom), one socket only on one side of the bed, very slow internet, no bathrobes, old kettle with limescale, breakfast is mediocre, the stuff is polite but too serious (they never smiled once).\nOn the good side: great location and unique interior.\nFor this price you can find a much better hotel in Vilnius.",

The rooms are large and spacious.The day I was leaving the hotel, I asked the reception where the toilet was and he said it was upstairs, but the upper floors were dark, the lights weren’t on and I couldn't find it. Then I went downstairs again, he got sullen and angry. This was not nice at all, there are no lights and I can't find it, it's your problem.think you should learn how to treat tourists and guests or keep the lights on in your hotel!!!",
