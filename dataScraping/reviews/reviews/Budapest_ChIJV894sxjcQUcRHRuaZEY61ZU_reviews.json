And the stuffed cabbage does not have a nice balance so it's not hearty at all, just very sour as the sauerkraut was way too fermented. Not kidding when I say it's the worst meal I ever had in my life.\n\nService is little to none but I don't expect much as a tourist.",

Overall, a great lunch was had.",

When my server presented the bill he said \"there is a service charge that goes to the kitchen, if you were happy with your service and would like to leave some for me you can do that here.\" You had the credit card terminal pulled up with the gratuity % options I didn't even get time to look at my bill. I realized after that there was 14.5% gratuity already on it. I don't care about the amount but the fact the server lied and said there was a service fee for the kitchen when I know that's not true at 14.5%. So instead I ended up paying a 29.5% gratuity. I should have been paying more attention,  but you also shouldn't be worried about getting scammed out of your money",
