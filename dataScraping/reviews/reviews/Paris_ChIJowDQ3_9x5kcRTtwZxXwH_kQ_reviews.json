A burning fire in the fireplace completes the very pleasant atmosphere in the cold months. Pleasant staff, always willing to help. Thank you for a pleasant stay.",

The staff was wonderful and so accommodating! We will definitely stay again in the future. And of course Paris was lovely even in the rain!",

The large lounge was delightful for relaxation and meals when we chose to stay in - car service arrived quickly to get to our dinner reservations and rooms were cleaned beautifully every day of our stay. I would return with pleasure.",

This is a stunning gem set on an interior courtyard off the beautiful Place de Voges. Everything was perfect: an attentive and highly professional staff, beautifully appointed and comfortable rooms, a sumptuous breakfast. It exceeded our expectations in every way. Highly recommended!",
