The stairs are quite long so keep this in mind.\n\nThe room smelled really bad of cigarettes, and the toilet didn’t flush well. But the room was big, it had an air conditioning and it had two TV’s.\n\nWe expected a breakfast with more options, but they served us a plate with food from the kitchen. We thought we could decide and have more options, but we didn’t get it. And the hotel doesn’t have gluten-free bread.",
