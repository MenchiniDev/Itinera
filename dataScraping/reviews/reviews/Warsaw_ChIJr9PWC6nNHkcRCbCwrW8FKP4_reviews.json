But the pizza made up for the disappointment as it was really fresh and delicious. Still, the pasta was not up to the mark. The desserts were delicious. Overall, I felt the pricing were very high for the portions and taste.",

We were lucky not to wait the table for a long time. Food was coming fast, service was good. Dessert could be better, it was overdone.",
