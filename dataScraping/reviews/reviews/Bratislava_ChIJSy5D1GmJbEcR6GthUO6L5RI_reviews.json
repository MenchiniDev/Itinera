            "text": "I was in Bratislava a week ago, and since I was nearby, I used Google Maps to find a suitable restaurant. This one seemed interesting, with affordable prices and delicious food.\n\nI was a bit hesitant because of the negative reviews about the staff, but I didn't encounter that. The waiter I approached didn't understand my question in English, so he brought a girl from the kitchen who showed me where I could sit - I needed a table close to the sockets. I didn't have to wait long for beer or food, and the waiter was polite.\n\nWhen it comes to beer, I cannot say much since I'm not much of a beer fan, but the food lived up to all expectations. I ordered chicken steak on asparagus risotto with parmesan and bacon chips (kurací steak na špargľovom rizote s parmezánom a slaninovom chipsom).",
