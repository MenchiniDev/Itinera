We had bruschetta, ravioli, seafood with pasta,marinated fish, tiramisu & cannolis. Highly recommend!",

            "text": "La Locanda Dei Borboni was a discovery we made while wondering around the city streets, a lovely little restaurant that transports you to somewhere else as soon as you walk through the door.\n\nThere are a few tables served by a kitchen at the back of the restaurant, this place is cute but packs a big punch serving some absolutely amazing seafood dishes. The freshness and taste is so good, and because it's such a small venue it also has that warming home cooked feel. Food made with love.\n\nThe great experience was also made from our waitress, who was originally from Sri Lanka but is also a local being completely fluent in Italian and the Neapolitan dialect. The thing that she and the restaurant give you is an experience of the pride of Naples and the South of Italy.",
