The service was good although our table wasn’t ready on time and we needed to ask for the bill a few times. I had the escargot and Niçoise salad which were nothing special. Overall a good one off experience as a tourist.",

However, given that it was July, it was very hot and the terrace had nothing for cooling, just umbrellas (no fans, no water vapor system). Good food, very good and served qiuckly even though it was very crowded. Very clean brasserie, very clean toilets, although it was very crowded.",
