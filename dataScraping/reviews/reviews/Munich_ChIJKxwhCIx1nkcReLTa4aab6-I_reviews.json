Absolutely loved the atmosphere, it was packed but there are a lot of attentive and friendly staff.\n\nThe place has a real buzz and the menu is decent. We shared a starter of carpaccio beef, then had two mains, a pasta dish and the tiger king prawns.\n\nDespite the queue of people waiting to get in we never felt rushed.\n\nWould highly recommend.",
