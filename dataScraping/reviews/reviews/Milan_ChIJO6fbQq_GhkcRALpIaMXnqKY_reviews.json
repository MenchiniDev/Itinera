A bit of street noise from our 2nd floor location but not enough to really bother us. Wonderful location 5 minutes to Duomo. Very helpful staff. If you go for the more \"upscale\" side of the hotel (which I believe costs more) you get access to a lovely eating/relaxation area with its own concierge. Free breakfast and snacks throughout the day! Can't wait to return. Highly recommended.",

            "text": "Trust my review and do not stay in this hotel. If location is important to you then by all means consider it but otherwise run away!!  Firstly, It took us forever to check in because the hotel staff were very slow. We could tell they were taking their sweet time and making small talks to everyone.\n\nWhen we got to the room we noticed that it was really warm. Turned on the AC but it was not working! It was literally a sauna! Called the concierge and they said it was due to the AC getting changed for the winter! They offered a pathetic fan instead and offered no compensation! Imagine paying almost 500 CAD per night and getting this in return!\n\nThe breakfast buffet was just disappointing and disgusting. The scramble eggs tasted like eating a tub of wet cement.\n\nWhen we were checking out we asked for a compensation or at least some service recovery and the lady said there wasnâ€™t anything she could do. So there you go! Stay there at your own risk!",

The  coffee this morning 25/9/24 at the breakfast buffet was made with LOVE and SMILE  ( a big smiley face on the foam of the cappuccino) by a very special barista. We thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's the fine details such as this make  our stay memorable ðŸ˜ƒ!",
