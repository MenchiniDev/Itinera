I don‚Äôt know of it‚Äôs something against tourists in particular or just general disdain but when we sat down we waited 30 minutes for someone to take our food order (after ignored 5 times with a place that wasn‚Äôt even busy to begin with and having to flash my phone LANTERN light to get a waiter to come) just to be told that they were only serving pizza. When I said I wanted a salad like the gentleman from the table behind me they said it wasn‚Äôt possible. Photo of said salad which I took after asking the man for permission. RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL & TERRIBLE! Stay away\n\nPS- staff buying SHOTS for those next to us to write a nice review (5 or 6 people at the table) is just CRINGE ü§£",

When I asked ‚Äúexcuse me what?!‚Äù He already asked the other bouncer to pull me away from the queue. If you have a dress code just say so. Just because I had piercings and black eyeliner I was immediately insulted. As a techno dj and event organiser that lived in London for over 11 years, you clearly don‚Äôt know how to do your job properly. Rude, aggressive and disrespectful.
