A little downside is soundproofing - the street traffic can wake you up very early. This wasn't an issue for me but it's good to be prepared for it.",

The only thing witch I didn't like there was a door in my room and I could hear everything from the next room and I didn't feel comfortable.",

Service so so and nothing special. Breakfast average …",
