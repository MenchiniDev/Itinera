            "text": "Awful experience, do not recommend!\n\nWe booked a twin room with Booking and it was not clear that the bathroom was shared. It is not a comfortable place overall in summer, in our room was only a sad fan and no mirror. The sheets were for the winter season, sleeping was a difficult task due to the lack of AC. Also the room in front of us was under construction and very early in the morning (9am) we could hear all the noise. Furthermore, the hostal is located in a noisy neighbourhood where drunk people and cars pass by blasting music at full volume during the whole night. The hostal entrance stinks and also there is no laundry room only for the staff so shared areas are sometimes taken up by staff. Lastly, the app system being used to access rooms fails way too many times and makes accessing your room unnecessarily hard. In short:\n\n- Awfully hot\n- Noisy\n- Bad room access system\n- All in all, uncomfortable",
