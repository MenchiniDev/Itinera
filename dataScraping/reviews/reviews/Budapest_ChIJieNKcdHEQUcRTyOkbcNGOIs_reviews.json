The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, making me feel right at home from the moment I walked through the door. The room was spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated, providing a cozy sanctuary after a long day of exploring Budapest. All amenities were top-notch. The hotel's location was perfect, offering convenient access to the city centre. Additionally, the complimentary breakfast buffet exceeded my expectations with a wide array of delicious options to choose from. Overall, my experience at Actor was nothing short of fantastic, and I can't wait to return for another unforgettable stay.",
