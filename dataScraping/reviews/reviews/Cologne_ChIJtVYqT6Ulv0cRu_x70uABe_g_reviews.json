It came in two styles: one boiled and one fried. Both were delicious, with the skin perfectly crispy, though it occasionally felt a bit sticky to the teeth.\n\nThe beer was also excellent, and the server would enthusiastically bring a beer basket to refill our glasses from time to time, providing great service.",

The service was also timely and good for a large group that I was part of.\n\nThe prices are a bit expensive, the burger was 17.5 euro but it is explained by the location and popularity among tourists.",

Google Maps did us a favor in finding this great pub. In the Mid-western US (Indiana) the breaded pork tenderloins inspired by German immigrants have been my favorite, but these were beyond words. The brown sauce was the icing on the cake and our server was busy but took very good care of us. Sehr Gut!",
