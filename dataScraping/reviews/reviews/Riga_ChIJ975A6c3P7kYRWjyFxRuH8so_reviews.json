            "text": "We've thought about coming here for a while now, and we're glad we stopped by the other night for supper. The upstairs seating was full, so we had to go downstairs to the family area (also other seating areas down there but not quite as nice as upstairs eating areas). It may be a good idea to make a reservation to get certain seating within the restaurant. The service was great and we really enjoyed our meals and dessert. It has a pretty big and diverse menu to choose from, so it shouldn't be hard to find something for all tastes.",

The roast pork with mushroom sauce was delicious.\n\nThe ambiance was great although the seating was somewhat odd for its low height. Prices were good plus an enjoyable evening.",
