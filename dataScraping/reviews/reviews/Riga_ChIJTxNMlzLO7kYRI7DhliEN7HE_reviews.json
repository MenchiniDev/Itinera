Enough English was spoken by the staff that we were able to communicate.  They were able to adjust my portion size, so I didn't feel I was wasting food. Portions were generous and filling. Food choices were simple,  but very adequate.  Staff were friendly and helpful.",

It was quite quiet when we went so there wasn't much atmosphere but it was still welcoming\nThe staff were really tolerant of my lack of speaking Latvian and still helped me pick food by pointing out things which is much appreciated. It was nice to try different types of food",
