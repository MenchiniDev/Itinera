The location was perfect for transport and great to get to from airport involving a quick bus ride direct from airport to metro, straight off metro to opposite hotel. Free travel if you are over 65 for any nationality! Room was spacious and very clean. Great shower. Would def recommend Hotel Botanique.",

            "text": "Fabulous with a sense of doing something for the environment. Very clean and quiet hotel. All the staff were very proactive. The mini fridge is a bit limited to one bottle of water on arrival which is a bit stingy. The rooms are super clean and products all natural/vegan ( though we are not lol ).  Breakfast is very good with something for everyone.  Late check out available til 6pm for €60 we chose to stay until 4pm ( €39 ).  A very modern comfortable hotel that puts sustainability at the heart of its purpose. Would absolutely come back here.",

            "text": "Love the concept of the hotel - reduce plastic waste and conserve the environment. They also offer a relatively healthier breakfast (great selection of loose leaf teas) compared to other hotels. Those were the reasons why we chose the hotel. We do wish there were more vegan options though than advertised. The room was spacious. The hotel was well located, right next to the metro and tram stops as well as the bus station for domestic travels. Also a nice 15 minute walk to the old town/main sites",
