            "text": "Our stay in the hotel was okay, but we expected more value with the high(ish) price.\n\n+ clean room\n+ free and easy guarded parking (a bit narrow parking lot though)\n+ good location, 20-30minutes walk to the old city centre and also pretty easy place to drive to\n+ the room had a fridge.\n+ no complaints regarding the hotel staff\n\n- breakfast was not the best, especially for a vegetarian. There were no fruits, only one type of bread and mostly different kinds of meats. If you eat meat, the breakfast is probably okay. No vegan options (unless you want to eat tomatoes and pepper).\n- the room was noisy, the air conditioning devices in the next building made a loud noise, which was right next to our window. Would recommend the usage of earplugs.\n-we had no air conditioning and the room was hot.\n-the showering was an experience. The shower holder didn't work and the shampoos were packed to small plastic bags (and only one bag of soap per person).",

            "text": "The location of the hotel in relation to its price is great - there is an excellent restaurant around the corner and the old town centre is about 1.4 km away, so about half an hour walk. The room we occupied was clean and nice, the noise from the kilmatization on the opposite building was hardly audible. The receptionist was cold and distant. The problem was at breakfast - a bit of rotten sausage that made us sick, and a loud TV on. Is it really necessary in 2023 to have terrible 90s pop blaring for breakfast? Or did the hotel just want to show it had a TV? At breakfast, a quiet meal is far preferable to the annoying output from the screen.",

There was a good selection of food for breakfast not all to my taste but I didn't go hungry. For a 3star hotel I wasn't expecting a lot but did expect better, would definitely not choose to stay here again. Which is such a shame as I said the staff on reception where wonderful and very helpful and I would place all faults on owners and higher management.",
