We did not use the pool outside but I can tell it is not big due to the surrounding of the hotel. It is quiet place. Staff in the hotel is very polite and welcoming. One small remark I have is that you can smell the food from the kitchen in the garden and part of the lobby area.",

The hotel itself was super clean, the food good, the drinks well made, the beds were comfy and the showers were great. Literally the only negative is that it would have been nice to have the pool open later on the year, as it was still plenty hot enough outside.",

We stayed two nights to rest after our trip before heading south and was really pleased with the experience with the garden and pool. Since it was super hot we didn't check out the city much but the location seemed great as well.",

The first time, they ran after my taxi for payment for something they incorrectly claimed I had given to be laundered--a system mistake, but it quite upset me. This time, everything went smoothly. The breakfast buffet is enormous, and there is something for all tastes, including vegetarian, and a few vegan options (plant milk, fruit, nuts). There's a little swimming pool in the courtyard if you have children, and a delightful cat family that I am pleased to say they have not chased away. There's not much around the hotel, you need to walk two blocks to get to the Blloku area with shops, cafes, restaurants.",
