They serve authentic and non generic north indian dishes like missi roti, sarson da saag, and many more which are Indian dishes that you won't find in other restaurants in Milan.\n\nService was good. Prices are a little bit on the higher side. I will suggest malai kofta (spicy version) and lahsuni naan (garlic nan).",
