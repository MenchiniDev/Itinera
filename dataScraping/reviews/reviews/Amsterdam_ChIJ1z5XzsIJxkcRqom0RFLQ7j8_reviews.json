I slept with my windows open and didn’t hear anything all night. The breakfast was a very good, elaborate continental breakfast with fresh bread, egg, hard-boiled egg, croissants, a great coffee machine, and a few options for yogurt and fruit and veggies. Both of the reception area and the breakfast room are quite charming and well decorated with older Dutch decor and antiques. Oh and the breakfast room looks out onto the charming street and canal! I would highly recommend this place!",
