The parmesan jar was sandwiched between bread slices. The food was tasty and I was asymptomatic after the meal but I find the event including bread to be real health hazard. I am sure it was only a mistake but please if you are dining there double check everything and remind the staff about your dietary requirements.",

It was good, in the classic European way we had to wait a while to have our order taken, the French table beside us tried flagging them down multiple times for over ten min but eventually they spoke to the manager and left. Overall though we enjoyed it and it was around 3 pm when a lot of places were closing down.",
