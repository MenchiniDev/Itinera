Food is good but quality/price may be better, portions are quite small and you can get hungry if you take just the main . Good selection of wine, few italians but not bad. Atmosfere is super and the terrace very nice.",

We expected fine dining experience, but no, see the photo of the margarita! First we got it without any salt around the rim, went to complain, got an answer that there is no salt available (?!) and eventually received a corrected one which is awful.",
