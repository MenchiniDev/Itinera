The decor was cool though seems like was designed a while ago. The checkout and all the staff were super which made this a great experience. And v good breakfast",

The bathroom is separated by frosted glass panels from the bedroom (also with a large hole acting as the door handle) so fine for a solo traveller or for those who don‚Äôt need privacy when in the bathroom. No acoustic padding between floors meaning the heavy heeled will sound like a herd of elephants to those in the room below. Didn‚Äôt order breakfast (‚Ç¨19/day) but the location is excellent - any direction walking 15 mins and you hit a main sight. Nice quiet street /safe area.",

It is also really quiet at night. It is located very near the Humboldt Forum and the Museum's Island, if you like taking walks instead of using the Metro. The rooms are big and convenient and they are cleaned daily! The ladies at the reception are always happy to help. A very pleasant experience, totally recommend it. So much better than other hotels around! üòÅ",
