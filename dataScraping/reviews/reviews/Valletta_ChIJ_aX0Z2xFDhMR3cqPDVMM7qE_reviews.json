But service not-guys were confused and must say that only one of them was fast nad client-oriented(maybe his name was Roberto) We were sitting 45 minut only with water and prosecco. No bread, olive oil…Tables around us were served fast…so we didn’t understand.",

We tried the short ribs, the duck and the octopus appetizers to our delight, one as good as the other. We also enjoyed our main courses the Secreto Ibérico pork was perfect, the steak was served at the perfect temperature and delicious. We also enjoyed the Sea Bass, what a treat. Replay came perfectly plated with delicious accompaniment and a visual and gourmet treat.\nThe service was professional but personal. Great restaurant to rival many of Michelin stared establishments I have had the pleasure to visit.\nA must visit when in Malta. Enjoy!",
