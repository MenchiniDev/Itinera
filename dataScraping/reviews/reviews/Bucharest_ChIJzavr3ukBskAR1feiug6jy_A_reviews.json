Can't say I didn't enjoyed my pizza which was reasonable large for the price of it. Will come again at 10PM. The music was diverse and the furniture was in balanced with the purple ceiling. Really liked that.",

The soup after (and many more fantastic romanian dishes) is a miracle that everybody can try after a long and very hard event that rip you off all your powers (open 24h). Clean, civilized and a gem of culinary experiences in Bucharest. Recommend it to everyone!",
