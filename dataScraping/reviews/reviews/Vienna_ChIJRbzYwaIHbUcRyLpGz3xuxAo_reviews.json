The room was very spacious and clean, there was a cleaning service everyday.\nThe location was perfect, super close to the center and every big attraction was walking distance, but it was on a quiet street.\nWe were two women staying there, and it always felt safe even at late hours.\nWe really recommend this hotel, itâ€™s incredible, and amazing value for money.",

The room was exceptionally clean, featuring elegant parquet flooring, and was bright and stylish, just as a guest would expect. The breakfast was a highlight, offering a delicious and varied selection catering to both meat eaters and vegans. The quality of the food was impressive, with fresh and tasty options available. Overall, my stay was delightful, and I highly recommend Hotel Das Tigra for its cleanliness, design, and excellent breakfast.",
