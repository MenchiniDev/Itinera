All that with salad and beer. For dessert we had the apple pie and a traditional dessert. The staff was welcoming and nice. However, it was a little bit overpriced.",

The food was delicious, with the pork loins being particularly tender and juicy. Drinks are fairly priced and food tends on the more expensive side but not unreasonable for the quality. The service was quick and friendly.",

The wine selection is good and the view of the river just accentuates the place. Right next to the bridge and they do speak English if you needed. Don't fill up on just one dish because their menu is huge. On that note you will not leave here disappointed!",
