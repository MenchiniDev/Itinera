One dessert- cheesecake was good but tiramisu wasn’t. Overall I would say average Italian food- we are used to much better food in our travels and at home in London",

They had several choices, and the food was really good.  (only the burata is GF in this photo, I forgot to take a pic of my pizza).  We did end up taking a good portion of this pizza back to the apartment we rented out and heated it up and it was just as good the next day - so double thumbs up for that.",
