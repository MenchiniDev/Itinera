I think this place also has the cleanest toilets of any McDoandls that I have visited.  Food was served with a delay of about 10 minutes, but we were made aware of this before we ordered.  So no complaints there.",

There was a kids play place inside which was nice after driving for several hours. It was located just minutes away from the heart of San Marino.",
