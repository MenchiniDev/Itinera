The rice was raw and switched my red curry shrimp soup with someone else.\nThey don't seem to be bothered about your complaints not even the manager.\nThey've over changed me and didn't compensate for the wrong order.\nI will not recommend eny one to go there.  If you want good customer service and be treated with respect dont waist your hard earned money in places like this,  they're absolute con and thieves,  watch out,  check your bill before paying.",

Philadelphia, in their opinion, looks like ordinary maki rolls with cheese on top (look at the photos).  Inside the roll there is only a little salmon.  Udon shrimp soup is very strange.  Why make crispy breaded shrimp and then dip them into soup?  It became soggy and unpleasant.  Hot rolls are quite tasty, but crackers are sweet.  it's like rolls with the taste of donuts)) the service is polite, the restaurant inside is pleasant, the prices are normal.  Work with food!",
