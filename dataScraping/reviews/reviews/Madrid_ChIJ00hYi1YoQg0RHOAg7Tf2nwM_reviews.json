Very closed to a Metro station with access to multiple lines so very easy to get to all attractions we were interested in. Staffs were super nice and helpful. Breakfast has decent variety of hot and cold items.",

If this was a cheap hotel, yes Iâ€™d not expect anything, but for 300 euro per night, look for another option. There is nothing around, all main attractions are transport away. Easy access, but still for the price you can get a lot better hotel and centrally located.",

The cooked food was under cooked (sausages and bwcon) although the scrambled eggs were lovely. The coffee machine was nespresso pods which isn't environmentally friendly. All else excellent",
