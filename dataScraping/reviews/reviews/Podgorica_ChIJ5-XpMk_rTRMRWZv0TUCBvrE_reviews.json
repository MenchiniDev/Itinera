When I wanted to prepay for the lunch, the waiter was concerned why I don't give him any tip. Portions are big, but the taste... I've never eaten that dry meat in my life. The chicken risotto was tasteless, only chicken was recognizable. If we weren't so tired as we were, we wouldn't eat it at all.",

(also there are some vegatarian options wich is not very common in Podgorica). The service was top-notch, with attentive staff who made sure everything was just right throughout the meal.\nOverall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visting the town.",
