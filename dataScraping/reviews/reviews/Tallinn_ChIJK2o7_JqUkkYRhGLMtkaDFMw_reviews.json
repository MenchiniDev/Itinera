Location is just minutes from the corner of the old town and right beside a bus stop.\n\nThe interior of the hotel and the rooms are meet and up-to-date. Bathrooms are in good condition. Mattresses and other furnishings are very comfortable.\n\nThey have central air conditioning and it is very effective when it gets too humid!\n\nWe enjoyed the breakfast. It had more than the typical items expected.",

Breakfast was wonderful with good choice and in restaurant there are quite big children corner, where they can go to play and socialize. The only let down was parking - it is paid and as receptionist explained runned by Europark and so it is a bit pricy, I believe holes in the parking area will be fixed soon. My stay was nice and I love hotels like this.",

Room was okay (some parts like bathroom can take a bit of renovation in) and somewhat too compact. Breakfast was amazing, they have variety of great food to satisfy any taste and big selection of drinks. Clean amenities. Housekeeping staff left us vouchers for 2 free drinks at the restaurant. We walked to the Old Town from\nThe hotel, its like 1km away (15 mins walking), i find it very convenient. Front desk has a room in the back if you want to store your luggage after the check out. Ate pizza at the restaurant downstairs before we left, food and service were great. Thank you & i would stay there again.",
