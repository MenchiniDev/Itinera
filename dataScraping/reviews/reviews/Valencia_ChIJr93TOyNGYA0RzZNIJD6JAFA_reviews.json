We booked our session before and when we reached they let us wait like 10 mins to enter and then inside the customer service was bad the lady always giving instructions and like she was in a bad mood yesterday and she wants to share her bad vibes with people.. I usually went there and I got a better customer service.. so sad to put 1 star but this is actually what she deserve.",

            "text": "The hotel itself is situated in a good location, but this does not make up for the quality of service. My room had loose tiles in the bathroom with bits of the floor being uneven and causing a trip hazard. Furthermore, we were in desperate need for ice as one of my companions got heat stroke and they made us pay for it! Hotel guests were rude (zenophobic) and staff did not bother to intervene. They really should consider hiring a security guard as it seems normal members of staff are not capable of dealing with difficult customers. Food was lukewarm, churros barely defrosted and there was no signage showing what the food even was which is a massive hazard when travelling with people that have food intolerances. Even when asking the kitchen staff they weren't 100% sure what they were serving. The only thing that was nice about this place was the view onto a pretty looking ALDI.",

The hotel pool is lanes and swimming caps are required. The beds are very firm, and the pillows so thin they are useless. The walls are paper thin and have no discernible sound absorption qualities.\nMany floors are textured and hard cases make a light thunder like noise when passing your room.\n\nWifi is patchy as hell - we got ",
