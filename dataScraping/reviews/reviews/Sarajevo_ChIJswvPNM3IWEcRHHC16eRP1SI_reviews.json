The atmosphere is warm and authentic, with a beautiful view of Sarajevo that adds to the experience. The staff were friendly and attentive, making sure everything was just right. It‚Äôs a bit pricier, but the quality of the food and the whole dining experience make it worth it. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Sarajevo!",

            "text": "My Partner booked this restaurant for my birthday and I was incredibly impressed with each the service, food, atmosphere, drinks and view of the city. The food was some of the best I have had across more than 25 cities of travel and the service was impeccable, the wine selection and variety of spirits on offer was also a bonus. The staff were very accommodating of us despite our not being overly familiar with the food on offer and suggested that we try half portions of each dish to try a bit of everything, we loved everything we tried. Highly recommended for a special occasion with a special someone, the view and atmosphere are unmatched and they also have live music and a great selection of after dinner drinks and desserts. 10/10.",

We weren't disappointed.\n\nIf you get a window seat you get a great view out over Sarajevo.\n\nGet a taxi to and from here, it's quite a steep hill to climb up if not",
