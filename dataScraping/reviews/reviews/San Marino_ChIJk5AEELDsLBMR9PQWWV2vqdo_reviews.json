Only then were we told that the menu is available online by scanning the QR code. We ordered a mega mix of fried food as an appetizer, and it was disappointing‚Äî‚Ç¨10 for mostly fries. We checked Google reviews and the photos taken by previous customers, and what we received was not the same.\n\nWe ordered gnocchi and pasta. The taste was good until I realized my pasta was microwaved. Some pasta was still cold and stuck together from not heating up properly.\n\nThe location is amazing, but I wish I had ordered a pizza so they couldn‚Äôt cheat with microwaved food.",

Super friendly server who spoke enough English to street is to the right choices including local wine.  We each enjoyed a salad - portion size is huge; we should have shared a salad!  Very fresh ingredients and very tasty.",
