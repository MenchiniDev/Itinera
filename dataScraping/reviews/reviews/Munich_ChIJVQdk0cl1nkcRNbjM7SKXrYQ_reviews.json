There were a few dirty spots visible, if your room is on the bussy side of the street you can hear the cars, me personally didn't bother this. The shampoo and soap were amazing! I do recommend this hotel not only for single people but also for family traveling with 2 kids",

We brought this up downstairs and they sent someone up to clean it. We then also found a bug under our comforter the second night which made us not sleep well. When we went to report this early in the morning before we had to catch our train there was no one around. This hotel was \"cheaper\" than others with Oktoberfest going on, if it was clean and we didn't find a bug I would've given them 4-stars.",
