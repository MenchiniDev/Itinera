I wish I had a second stomach to fill it up with the divine dishes here! Every meal is cooked with love and is mouth watering. The house wine (Nebbiolo) complements the meal ideally. Very nice traditional atmosphere!\n\nThis is now one of my favorite places in all of Italy!",

After two so-so dinners I was at the Osteria tonight.\nAnd it was definitely worth the long walk from the Centro storico!\nFood was great (antipasto misto and agnolotti), the cheese plate was absolutely incredible ‚Ä¶ loved it!\nAdd on top a friendly staff and it‚Äôs a perfect hit! Thanks so much for this wonderful dinner! Can‚Äôt wait to be back in 3 days!",
