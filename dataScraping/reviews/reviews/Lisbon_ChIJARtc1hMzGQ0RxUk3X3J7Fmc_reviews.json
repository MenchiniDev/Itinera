The hotel staff are friendly and attentive, they with provided helpful suggestions for attractions and directions. There were plane’s flying over the hotel, but was not an issue, could barely hear them. Would definitely stay here again!",

They charged my phone, called me a taxi, and had a laugh with me together. Ana, Christina & the lovely security guard gentleman at the door, I'll be forever grateful!",

We had to turn on/off switches many times to get it on. The beds were hard and the WiFi never worked. Other than that, it was safe, good location, good breakfast, great view from the top.",

Biggest pro is the location - it’s right outside Praça de Espanha metro station and situated halfway between the airport and the Lisbon historic city center. Service was good as well.\n\nThe hotel itself could use some work though. The rooms are a little dated and worn, and had a weird musty smell. Wifi also never worked inside. Bathroom was nice and clean though.\n\nWith a little improvement to the rooms this could be a really great hotel.",
