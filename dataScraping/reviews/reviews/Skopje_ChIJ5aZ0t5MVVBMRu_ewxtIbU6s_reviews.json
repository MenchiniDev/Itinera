            "text": "I recently visited Five Star Fast Food in Skopje and had a delightful experience. The restaurant offers a wide variety of fast food options, from burgers to sandwiches, all prepared with fresh ingredients. The service was quick and efficient, making it a great spot for a quick meal on the go.\n\nThe highlight of my visit was the cheeseburger, which was juicy and flavorful, complemented perfectly by crispy fries. The portion sizes were generous, and the prices were reasonable, offering good value for money.\n\nThe atmosphere was casual and welcoming, with clean seating areas and friendly staff. Whether you’re dining in or taking out, Five Star Fast Food ensures a satisfying experience. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a tasty and convenient meal in Skopje.",

I haven't seen that in any other fast food restaurant here. This is the definition of \"fast food\". I recommend 7 to absolutely everyone who likes traditional, not so fancy but absolutely juicy and tasty as hell burgers !",
