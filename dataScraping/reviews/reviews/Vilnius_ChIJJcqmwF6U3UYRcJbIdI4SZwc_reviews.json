            "text": "I wouldn't call amicus neither hotel nor hostel. It's really a HOLE where no one should stay. It is said in the description that there is 24 hour desk but when we wrote that our plane lands at night they said that the reception is open until 8 and they will lave the key and the instructions on how to get into the property. That did not seem a problem. Although when we got into the room, we found beds in which someone has already slept. lots of empty bottles and glasses towels all over the room.\n\nIn the middle of the night we had to look for another hotel because it was impossible to stay there with small children.\n\nAfter this incident the owners of the property did not even call to apologize or to explain the situation.\n\nSteer away from this place",

            "text": "Appreciate the helpful and welcoming service. Clean hotel, calm place around with some fresh greenery. Lovely style and cozy inside the hotel. Close by the airport (keep in mind that this is the reason why there might be noise late in the evening or at 4am because of other travelers).\nThe downsides were very poor sound isolation (we could hear another person peeing behind the wall!!! ðŸ˜³), not good for privacy or peace and quiet as the walls are paper-thin.\nAlso, our room's bathroom smelled like sewer and rusty pipes a little bit and like some chemicals / fragrances in an attempt to hide that. Well, it's a 3 star hotel, after all...\nAll in all, it was a good stay, and thank you for helping to calm down the noisy guys which improved the rating and makes one gain more trust in the service.",

We also loved their breakfast - it's worth four stars! We stayed here out of season, and were upgraded to a small apartment although we paid for a basic room. They also organised a reasonable taxi for us, which was very kind!",
