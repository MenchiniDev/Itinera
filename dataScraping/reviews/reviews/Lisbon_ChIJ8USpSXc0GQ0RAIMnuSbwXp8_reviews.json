            "text": "Taberna Moderna serves us without compromise for more than 15 years as it is the rare restaurant with it all: delicious food and a good wine selection at fair prices with excellent personal service (Miguel is a true treat!!) in a beautiful ambiance filled with outstanding contemporary art, all of this in downtown Lisbon with an outdoor terrace on the square for the gin aperitivo from their extensive gin bar; it is a party when you need it and a romantic corner, when desired.\n\nWe were two for dinner and started with the most tasty peixinhos da horta on the terrace, a couvert. a deliciously braised fresh tuna for starters, the most tender octopus fillet for mains, with a delightful chilli sauce, and to top it the pennacota, all shared with waters, a rose and a coffee for €45/pax which is a steal at such quality!\n\nWe love it!!",

Drinks pricey. But a very nice gin bar.\nBut why are we told we're lucky to get the last free table when 80% remain empty? I don't get it.\n\nOh... get a changing table for the men's room. We're living in the 21st century.\n\nGood food, but definitely not good enough for the price.",

The rice was extremely flavorful, the octopus beautifully tender. I’d eat that forever.\n\nThe steak with fries and cheese sauce was also pretty tasty but the steak wasn’t anything special. The cheese sauce needed a bit more flavor. The fries were fast food like in shape but also could have had a more special quality to them.\n\nI liked the gin list and cocktails they made too based on preferences.",

Delicious dishes, especially salad with burrata and black rice with cuttlefish. Desserts are also at a height) Thank you for the evening, we liked it.",
