Located in a charming neighborhood, the restaurant has beautiful scenery in a picturesque setting that adds to the overall ambiance.\n\nThe food was exceptional, especially the veal cheek, which was cooked to perfection and simply melted in the mouth. The octopus dish was also a standout with just the right balance of flavors.\n\nWhile the mains were outstanding, the desserts were slightly disappointing in comparison. However, this did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the meal.",

The service was quite slow, and the food was good but not quite as impressive as we were led to believe by reviews. The food was appetizing but nothing memorable. Perhaps it was an “off night” for this restaurant. That being said, our waiter, Stephano, was very polite and generous with us and recommended some very good wine. He is the reason why I give this restaurant a 4-star review instead of 3. He made our experience here lovely. If we are to return, I hope the quality of the food improves.",
