            "text": "The best Brewery in San Marino!\n\nI got a chance to visit and take a look inside this amazing looking Brewery. The entrance was not easy to find but the extra effort put in to find this place was 100% worth it. The owner is very friendly and gladly shares his passion for brewing beer which you can taste in his wonderful selection of beers. I got the chance to try a few actually. I would highly recommend to try the 'Nostalgia di Bambergia'. It has got to be one of the most unique beers I ever had. You can drink then here in the pub or purchase them for on the go, so of course I had to take some beers home myself.\n\nSo if you are ever in the area and enjoy a good beer than this place is a must visit.\n\nSaluti! üçª",
