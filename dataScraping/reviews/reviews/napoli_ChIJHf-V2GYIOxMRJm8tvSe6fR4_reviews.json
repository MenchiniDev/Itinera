But your gluten-free base tastes really good no like other places that you eat a baked paper.\n\nService minus one for the one lady, with pony tail, dark hair which wasn't very 'friendly'. I felt a very negative vibe from her.\n\nA part of it, all good guys!\n\n❤️❤️\n\nWith Love,\n\nMona",

Service was great too, that staff were efficient and friendly. The restaurant may seem small from the outside but it does stretch quite far back with a lot of table space. Great experience",

The service was exceptional and very quick. We got a table right away as well, even though we came for dinner on a Sunday evening. The waiter spoke English and gave us really good advice on the starters and desserts. All around great experience and cannot recommend coming here enough when you’re in Naples.",

I've heard that Naples is the birthplace of pizza, and this hotel must be the place where pizza gets delivered straight to your table. If you come all the way to Naples and don't eat at this place, you're missing out. No matter how far you've traveled, make sure to experience real pizza here. This is where the locals eat, not focused on chasing tourist service, and the taste is heavenly. From my stay in Naples, I can confidently say that I have no regrets about dining here. Just go and taste it for yourself—the prices are reasonable, and the experience is unforgettable.",
