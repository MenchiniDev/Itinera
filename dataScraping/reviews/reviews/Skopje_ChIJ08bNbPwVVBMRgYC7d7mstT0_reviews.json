The mushroom pasta was delicious as well.\nEven though the restaurant is a non smoking area, the bar is for smokers so the whole place smells like cigarettes because it's not divided.\nI've been during day and night there. At night it has more like a club feeling. There was live music which was lovely.",

We enjoyed our afternoon chatting away with the vibrant staff and were welcomed with open arms.\n\nMosh would be a great place to visit during the weekend evenings to experience the local vibe.\n\nThis wonderful bar-restaurant was the perfect introduction to the quality of dining and establishments in Skopje.",
