The breakfast was delicious, and the service was excellent.\n\nFurthermore, we took advantage of the hotel’s guided tour. Our guide, Jens, was not only knowledgeable but also highly entertaining. He introduced us to the hidden gems of Vaduz that we would have otherwise missed.\n\nIn summary, we absolutely recommend this charming hotel, and we’re already looking forward to our return visit.",

            "text": "Just wow. Especially breakfast. You have to see it to believe it. Variety and quality is really top.\nIt’s still a four star hotel, so some slight hint of unfriendliness in the restaurant during dinner is forgivable. Dinner was great. Not the salat though. For 17 chf I’d expect three times more on the plate. The rest was very fresh, Rösti great. Would certainly recommend this place to a friend. Room was squeaky clean. Very quiet, what I appreciated a lot.\nSolid 5 star from me. ❤️",
