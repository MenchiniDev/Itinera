After the order (pepperoni pizza) we went outside again. In the middle of our conversation a lady (the owner I presume) came and ask my friend to put a Christmas paper decoration on the wall behind our booth with an excuse that she doesn't like to bother us by placing it herself. The pizza was very poor.",

If you are a tourist, please choose a different place to sit. We were here with our dog in the park and then decided to eat pizza here, but the waiter said to leave this place because of the dog. The place was practically empty when we arrived and I wish for them to have only empty tables in the future. Cheers!\n(Imate sliki od gosti sto se fotografirani na lokacijata vo park)",

Mans toilet's broken door with ventilation hose in front of the mirror. The worst thing was when we get the bill which was raised for 2 beers which we didn't had.
