            "text": "I had a fantastic meal here this evening. The food was exquisite, but it was the service from Laura that truly set this restaurant apart, elevating it from great to exceptional.\n\nSpecialising in traditional Piemontese cuisine and boasting a strong Google rating, we knew we were in good hands. We began by sharing the vitello tonnato, where the tonnato sauce had an intense and beautiful flavor, and the melanzane, which was stacked with fresh tomatoes and slathered in a delightful toma cheese sauce.\n\nFor our main course, we wanted to share three pasta dishes, and Laura was more than willing to accommodate. She explained that she left it up to the chefs to decide whether to serve them as three separate dishes or pre-shared. Ultimately, the dishes arrived in two stages. First, we were served a plate with two halves: one side with agnolotti and the other with tajarin in a rabbit and courgette ragu. Both were incredible, with intense flavors and clearly freshly made pasta. When we were ready for the gnocchi, Laura it brought outâ€”beautiful pillow-like puffs in a creamy Castelmagno sauce. It was incredibly decadent and sensational, though I was thoroughly stuffed by this point!\n\nMy partner opted for dessert, and we were brought two spoons for the bonet Piemontese, a traditional chocolate and almond bread pudding. We finished with a limoncello each.\n\nWe were seated outside near the classic Turin arches, making for a perfect Torinese experience overall.",
