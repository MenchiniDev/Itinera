The rooms are classic and accommodated with everything you might need for your stay. But the highlight of my stay was the hotel's restaurant. The menu has vegan and vegetarian options and if you are a meat lover, you should definitely give their beef a try.",

The temperature was around 29-30 degrees Celsius.\n3. The beds were simply mattresses stacked on top of each other, not proper beds.\n3. The toilet was filthy. There was literal excrement on the toilet seat, which they didn't clean immediately. I had to clean it myself.\n4. The staff was unfriendly and unhelpful.\n5. Instead of informing guests at check-in about the need to validate their card before going out, the staff left us struggling at the automatic ramp.\n5. For the first two days, we could eat in the dining area, but afterward, we were rudely directed to a different dining area.\n6. The cleaning staff was found sleeping in the lounge area.\n7. The paid parking was not clearly communicated during booking, leading to unexpected charges.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this place.",
