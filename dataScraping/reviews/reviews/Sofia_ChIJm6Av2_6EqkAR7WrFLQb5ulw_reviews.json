            "text": "We recently visited Happy Bar & Grill as a group of ten, and everything was perfect! They allowed us to sit in the garden since we had a dog with us, which was much appreciated. Despite not speaking Bulgarian, communication was smooth, thanks to their bilingual menus (Bulgarian and English) with pictures of each dish. My friends visiting from Italy were really impressed with the place, the food, and the affordable prices. Happy Bar & Grill is always a safe choice â€“ highly recommended!",

It's strange how no one could notice. Too bad I was regularly ordering from there. I won't order again from this location, but leaving the review for the restaurant managers to follow up with their staff, be more careful with the delivery bags, and look where those cockroaches came from.",
