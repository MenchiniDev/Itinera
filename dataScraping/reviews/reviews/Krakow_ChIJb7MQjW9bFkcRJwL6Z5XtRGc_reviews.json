Aircon works perfectly well. Lobby and bar modern and comfortable. Food was also great, we had some tapas at the bar.",

The water pressure was very very low, I never care about this type of thing but it took 10 minutes to rinse my hair instead of 2 minutes.\nAlso there was a Bluetooth sound system that the employees did not know how to start. I asked twice but nobody even knew what it was.\nHair dryer was very powerful but not wall integrated which felt a little \"cheap\".",

Funny thing is that u won’t get a drink and u have to use ur empty bottle to fill ur water at the lobby or buy from them. This kind of 4stars service is lousy. Not recommended for business travellers. Stay here for a week but I can’t get a bottle of water replenishment. Too bad no next time from corporate.",

They made my brother sit in the restaurant for 3 hours for 25 zloty. they could have put it under the room, the lobby guy “Micheal” was very rude and didn’t bother to help!!! The room was fine but had so many damages including a broken lock in the bathroom and the bathroom had a very bad smell, they aren’t being cleaned properly.The location is so far from the city as well. I wouldn’t suggest anyone to buy for breakfast if you wake up little late you will only find the leftovers..",
