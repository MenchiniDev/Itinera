Nobody checks your entry ticket, you just go ahead and sit when a little screen on top of the door tells you to. The rooms are super small so you see the movie with about two dozen people. I just found it lovely.",

Thatâ€™s mostly why I give three stars.\n\nPlus is that at least Rex shows the movies (or at least this one) in original languages. As a Dutch guy I despise movies that are shown in German ðŸ˜¬\n\nFurthermore you can see Rex has had better times. Itâ€™s all a bit old and worn down. But for a ticket price of â‚¬7,50 I guess you cannot expect IMAX facilities.",
