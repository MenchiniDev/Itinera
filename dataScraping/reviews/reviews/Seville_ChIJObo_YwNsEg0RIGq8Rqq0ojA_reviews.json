Eating while standing is totally normal here. The tapas are delicious, and the servers are very welcoming. Truly, no complaints at all.\n\nIt’s a must-visit as soon as you come to Seville, but be aware, it’s often crowded, so make sure to come early.",

You either eat at the bar or wherever they place you around the bar…. and it’s all standing. The food is mouth watering! We ordered the pig cheeks, loin chop and whitebait with two wines and we left extremely satisfied.",

We tried a range of dishes across two visits, mostly consisting of fish, and each one was delicious. The servers take care of you throughout your meal, and are patient and engaging. It is a place full of character.\n\nNB: don’t let the queue intimidate you, it shortens at a quick pace and the experience is well worth it.",
