No complaints about the staff at all, were pretty friendly. The breakfast was wonderful. The hotel was about a 15-20 minute walk to the Palais Princier and a 30 minute walk to Monte Carlo (if I remember correctly) - just be warned you’ll be walking uphill to see the sights! There is also a market not too far away.",

The building is dated, and while the rooms themselves are clean and modern looking, the bathroom is another story. It smells horrible and damp, and if you leave the door open, the whole room smells like drainage. There’s barely any room to store anything in the bathroom and almost no sockets in the bedroom. The breakfast is okay, nothing of note. Honestly the only good thing is the location, the discount on the car park and maybe the price.",
