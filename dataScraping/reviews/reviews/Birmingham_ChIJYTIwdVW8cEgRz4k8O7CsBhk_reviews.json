There was food available up to 8.30pm which I had Monday pm which was very nice .Breakfast looked nice and available from 7am. I enjoyed staying in a older hotel with lots of character. The room was very spacious and clean. I must say all the staff were superb and friendly and present. Perfect for my trip and I would recommend and stay again. Couldn't fault it.",

The location and car parking offer a great package at a reasonable price. Beware there isn't a food offering, outside of breakfast, on the weekend including Friday night. On the subject of breakfast the offer is adequate but a little short of expectations these days. Overall we enjoyed our experience.",

On the upside, it was clean, quiet, and brilliant water pressure with plenty of hot water. No restaurant, so you order food from Deliveroo and collect it from reception. Location is good for all city centre journeys, a 4 minute walk from tram stop that takes you to New Street Station in 10 minutes. Some trees and a bit of lawn make you feel further away from the busy Hagley Road than you really are. Room wasn't serviced during my two night stay.",
