The location is central and very walkable to many tourist sights. However, it was still quiet at night since it is not right on the main shopping street (Gran Via). I will definitely be staying again if I come back!",

The room was spacious and well-equipped with a nice work desk. The bathroom was very clean with a usable bathtub. The location is excellent, right in the middle of the city yet hidden in a quiet square. They also had a secure room to hold your luggage, which guaranteed peace of mind. I'll definitely return.",

The hotel is very quaint and feels like a boutique hotel with bit beautiful wood stairs. The room was really nice and the gym- while small- has everything you need- plus an amazing view while you work out!",
