I cannot describe how satisfied we have been each time. Not just the location (not directly in the city centre but still only a short walk), but with an excellent view over Reykjavik and quiet. Rather, the entire hotel team makes the big difference. Everyone is very friendly, polite and really very customer-oriented. We are very grateful that we were able to spend a lovely and relaxing time again at the Fosshotel Reykjavik in a beautiful room. Many thanks to the management and the entire team. Our special thanks go to Justyna. We will be back!",
