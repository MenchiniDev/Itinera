The food portions are large and the prices are affordable, we also had a really delicious meal. Definitely a place you won't regret.",

Shopska salad was amazing and super delicious, nafora was good as well. Service was nice and fast.\nAlso it’s cheaper than some places.\nI recommend this place, just don’t choose ushtipci. :))",

The reviews were convincing so we decided to eat here. The menu was only in Macedonian, although we were able to read most of the cyrillic letters, we did not know what was written on the menu, so we had to use Google Translate with the camera function. An English menu would be nice. The food was excellent and the waiter was very nice. :) Recommended.",
