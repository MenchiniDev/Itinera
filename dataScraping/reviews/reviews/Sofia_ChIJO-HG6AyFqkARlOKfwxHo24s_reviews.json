The staff was polite overall, I had no issues with that. The menu for the food is waiting directly on the table, so that is something to be aware of as noone tells you about it. Price is good and the quantity of the dishes is good. However, I had on mh table ordered some meatballs that came with no sauce but only one small cherry tomato, which was a little disappointing. Overall, it is a good place for simple tasty Bulgarian food with good prices. I recommend the tarator cold soup!",
