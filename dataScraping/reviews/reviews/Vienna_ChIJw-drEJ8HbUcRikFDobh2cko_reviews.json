            "text": "The rooms are perfect, the staff were really kind and nice. The only cons of the hotel are that its located right next to a busy highway and a busy road, but you wont mind it since the noise insulation is really good. Not too far from the tram or U-Bahn station, parking is accessible, and the taxistand is right infront of the entrance of the hotel. Elevators are accessible, check in was fast, direct and easy. Parking is 10 euros a day, but its probably the best option for hotel visitors since its close, safe, and in the shade since the parking is right under the bridge.",

And what I see for the first time for 4* - no basic things as body lotion etc. And far away from the public transport station and of course from the city Center. By checking out was a lot of problems , because the reception girl didnâ€™t make correct booking which my company sent her and marked as â€žunpaidâ€œ the room, which actually my company paid.\nSo, never anymore",

            "text": "We stayed here for the Rolling Loud festival in Ebreichsdorf as it was nearby the bus lick up at Marx. Wow. I cannot express how great this hotel was. Our flight got cancelled the day we were supposed to travel to Vienna so we had to change to leave the next morning. The hotel was very accommodating for this and ensured we got an early check in at 11am. The rooms were lovely and included a bath/shower which was essential for after the festival. The staff were so lovely and always said hello when we came back from the festival. The cleaners did a really good job too everyday. The hotel also gave us a free late check out til 1pm since we had a later flight going home. Thank you so much to all of the staff at the hotel! Danke SchÃ¶n!",
