            "text": "I have no idea how this hotel is a 4- star hotel .\nWe booked a 2 bedroom and 2 bathroom room ( Joost) for 4 nights .\n\nPositives : hotel is in a great location . Easy access to public transportation.\n\nBreakfast was decent .\n\nOur room had a kitchen , washer dryer which is the reason I booked this big room .\n\nRoom was in 3 rd floor and a lot of stairs to get to there . Their staff helped with our luggage.\n\nNegatives :\n\nThe house is not cleaned properly . the day we checked in I called them and said there is a stain near the carpet ( something sticky ). Response was it would be cleaned the next day .  It was never cleaned until we left . Iron board when I tried to open there was a bra left there . This probably should have been noticed when they were cleaning the room . There was visible dirt in the bed room .\n\nThe kitchen stove exhaust is there but it never worked .  One of the stove burner knob was broken which they fixed next day . We mentioned this to front desk and they assure we could cook without exhaust . ( strange to have a hood with a switch that does nothing )\n\nThere is a big fancy bathtub with hand shower which I thought was convenient to give shower to my daughter but that was broken as well . We did ask them to fix it but they never got to it\n\nMaster bedroom door handle comes to your hand when you try to open or close the door\n\nUpstairs sink is leaking .  I have no idea why this house so less lights !\n\nOne of the  bed side lamp was there without a bulb !\n\nWe went to 3 different cities in this trip and stayed  at 4 different hotels . This hotel was by far the most expensive and the most underwhelming hotel that we stayed in this trip . I would not recommend the hotel.",

            "text": "Second time staying at this hotel, would stay here every time. Great location, close enough to walk everywhere but far away enough to have a nice quiet stay. The service was excellent, especially at the bar and restaurant. I was hosted by Daniel at the bar, he was very friendly and accommodating, gave me excellent service and recommendations for restaurants around the city as well as transportation advice. Could not recommend this hotel enough. Daniel and the rest of the staff made this a very nice and welcoming stay.",

During our stay we found more than 10 of these little insects in our room. For a 4 star hotel I expected much more for which I had to pay almost €200 per night. When checking out, they didn't even ask how your stay was, only if we had taken something from the mini bar.",

            "text": "Good location- not much else going for it\n\nBathroom smelt awful . Complained to staff who said they’d clean it but the smell never went away.\nHousekeeping ignored a do not disturb and came in at 8am to clean the room. Asked to come back later in the day but they didn’t so the room remained uncleaned.\n\nRealised I left a dress in the wardrobe only a few hours after checking out. Contacted the hotel who said they’d found it and advised that I should book a courier for return, which I did. When I called back to confirm they said the dress was no longer there and couldn’t explain what had happened. I told them that if someone had taken it to please ask them to return it, no questions asked, but they denied having ever have found it, despite telling me they had one day prior. I was passed from person to person at varying levels of management and still no one could come up with a good reason for why the dress had been found then suddenly went missing. The whole thing was left unresolved and I am still waiting for them to refund me for the prepaid courier service that was not needed.\n\nVery strange and frustrating interactions with staff. All need to be better trained at basic customer service .",
