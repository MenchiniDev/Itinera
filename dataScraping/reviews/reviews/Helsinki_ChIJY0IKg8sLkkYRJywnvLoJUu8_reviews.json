Bed duvets are not big enough and I always feel I have half of the body outside the blanket. I try to flatten the duvet but they redo it every single time. Also they don’t have body lotion.\nWhen big events happen (like now with Slush) a basement room with no window costs up to 370 euro and they never let you know when that price will increase.",

            "text": "Interesting place clearly updated but only to a point. I don't understand why (other than cost) why hotels, especially tourist hotels, have only one baggage holder when there's generally 2 people in a room. The lobby desk is periodically overwhelmed so they will not answer the phone. Mostly understandable. Breakfast is a free for all but I think it speaks more to the clientele than the hotel. People stay way too long at the tables when they are done causing a standing backlog. Also because clearing the tables is difficult it's hard to tell who's gone or not. Staff is helpful, great recommendations.  So I think the hotel is fine but to me it's one star too many. The mini bar in the room is bare bones.  I'd stay again but my expectations of the chain is that likely all of the properties are one star too high.",
