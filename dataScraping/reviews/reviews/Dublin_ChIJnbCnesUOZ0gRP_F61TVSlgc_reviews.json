Only reason I scored 9 instead of 10 is the the bathroom suite is a bit 'used' and the tv signal kept coming and going; I only watched it for the news & a political interview so it was frustrating. My brother in another room also had the TV problem. Thank you very much - would definitely stay again.",

But food was thoroughly delicious, service to our table was absolutely top class and the hotel gave me my parking time free of charge. I will return....",

            "text": "I recently stayed at Clayton Hotel Ballsbridge during a business trip to Dublin, and it exceeded my expectations. The hotel’s location is ideal—situated in a beautiful, historic building in a quiet part of the city, yet still close enough to the bustling centre. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, making sure I had everything I needed throughout my stay.\n\nMy room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed with modern amenities, offering both comfort and a peaceful environment for relaxation after a long day. The breakfast was also a highlight—plenty of options, fresh, and delicious.\n\nThe hotel’s proximity to the RDS and the serene grounds around it made it perfect for both work and leisure. Overall, my experience at Clayton Hotel Ballsbridge was excellent, and I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Dublin, whether for business or pleasure.",
