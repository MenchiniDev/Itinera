The calamari rings are served without any sauce, which is unusual for a dish with such a strong seafood flavor. The potato and meat complementary dish is quite good. The fried anchovies are tasty, but they also lack any accompanying sauce. The Chicken Caesar salad has an excessive amount of dressing; aside from that, it tastes perfectly fine.",
