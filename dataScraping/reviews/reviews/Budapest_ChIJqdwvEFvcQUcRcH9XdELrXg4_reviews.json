            "text": "Budapest Jazz Club is a really decent venue, perhaps unexpectedly slick and white colar. First i liked the fact that the restaurant and the concert hall are separated , unlike i.e. most of the leading New York clubs. So people are actually either eating (as I did at first) or listening to jazz music (I did that too). I found both experiences equally satisfying, obviously in each own way. My grilled pheasant breast came perfectly cooked with nice sides and garnishes. The small band at the concert hall did their job too. We will return.",
