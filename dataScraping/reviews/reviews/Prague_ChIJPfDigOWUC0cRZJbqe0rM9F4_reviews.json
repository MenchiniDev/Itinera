The staff were equally attentive, and also gave us excellent recommendations.\nThe decor and spacious rooms were much appreciated and made for a comfortable stay.\n\nWe look forward to returning!",

The staff are fantastic and so is the food.  We were given a loft apartment of the 3rd floor which was very large and comfortable.  There are no lifts as it is a palace converted to a hotel.  We climbed the stairs. Our apartment did not have any windows or views, just skylights. The room we had is not shown on the Accor or hotel website.  Will say that all Accor hotels have the most comfortable beds!!",
