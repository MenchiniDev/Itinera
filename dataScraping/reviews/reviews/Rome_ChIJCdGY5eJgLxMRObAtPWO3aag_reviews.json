            "text": "This is an excellent hotel! The best quality is the friendly staff that is very eager to help with recommendations for restaurants, sites to visit, and arranging taxis. The breakfast was wonderful with a nice variety of meats, cheeses, hot items, fruits, and juices. The coffee service was excellent! We did not try the restaurant at other times. The location is very nice being a little off the path of all the touristy things. Still walkable but quiet and away from the crowds. It's located around several Embassies so it felt very safe. We would definitely stay here again.",

Ivan assisted me in acquiring a translation for my license and Alexis gave us two world class recommendations for dinner. If I return the Rome this is the only hotel I would consider.  7 Stars wouldn’t be enough for this amazing property. I would also like to mention Luigi who handled our bags and transportation. He is a gem and one of the nicest people I’ve ever met.",

The chef is creative.  The presentation of food beautiful and was so delicious.  I highly recommend Lord Byron for a stay in Rome.",

Some have said the hotel is distant from things to do, we found it peaceful in a very busy city. We walked from the hotel to Vatican, coleseum, pantheon, forumn, and more. The staff was very friendly on the whole. Overall, I would absolutely stay with them again.",
