They should use some more spices but overall I was satisfied with the meal(shkembe soup and kebapcheta). Wouldn't return though.",

The server was able to help me in English and hand me an English menu.\n\nI really enjoyed the tripe soup and the divaka burger! The fries were crispy and tasty and they gave LOTS of sauce to dip them in! It was comparable to American portions so I was super full. Super nice dining area but they have reasonable prices. Would come back again!",

Baked pork knuckle ( pork pieces with smashed potato’s)\n3. Zagorka special (Bulgarian special beer)\n\nEverything looks fine and delicious. Must recommend. If possible also try Bulgaria raki (vodka)",

            "text": "I rarely complain about food, but I believe there are some areas where the Divaka burger could be improved. Firstly, the meat patty appears to be quite small in comparison to the bun. Secondly, the large amount of vegetables makes it difficult to eat the burger as a whole. Lastly, the bun became soggy and fell apart due to the excessive amount of sauce. The food in general was unsatisfactory. Besides that, the service and the atmosphere are quite nice.\n\nDuring my latest visit of the place I tried their new pizza. This piece of food is not a pizza at all. It is disgusting. The place has great atmosphere but I beg them to improve the quality of the food.",
