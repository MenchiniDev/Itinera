            "text": "If you find yourself thinking what and where to eat in Cologne to get a real local experience, this is your place.\nAnd you won't be alone in doing so -- it can be quite packed at times in there, but that's part of the experience, and the service is great in mastering and maneuvering through the crowds, while keeping it light and friendly to make you feel comfortable.\nAs for the food, the Haxe (pork knuckle) is simply excellent. Crispy as it needs to be on the outside, tender and juicy -- falling off the bone -- on the inside. Also the spicing is just right to bring out the full taste of the meat.\nThere are also daily dishes, which in our case was a pork neck steak, nicely grilled with potatoes and green beans -- again, simply delicious.",

The pork knuckle was very tasty and my vegetarian wife had plenty of options to choose from. The staff seemed a little overwhelmed, as my glass stayed empty more than it was full, but it was well worth the wait!",

Black forest cake, pork sausage and black beer were such a perfect combination to try during winter. The portion for pork knuckle was really “generous” for sharing portion.\n\nOther memorable things was a waitress that looks like Adele or Kristen Stewart, she was really helpful and friendly.",
