I've stayed at other Britannia hotels before, but for some reason, this one seems to struggle with check-in.\nRoom was clean and we had a big king size bed, but no window in the room and it was stuffy and hot, no TV remote or remote for the air-con.",

The bed sheets were very dirty, the shower curtain had green marks on it. The bag has stains It. The windows were just horrible. It was like stepping into a time machine,. Only one lift was working and we were put on a smoking floor. We Do No Smoke. We just couldn't stay, I booked another hotel just for the peace of mind and left. We didn't get a refund that was last of our worries. We will not be going back there again. They need to either shut it down or re do it up.",
