We went for an anniversary and we were very disappointed, people in Berlin recommend it a lot but don't know why. I guess just because looks fancy and is expensive but the service is terrible bad and the food not good at all. The worst is the waters and the hostess that just because one is not full of botox or makeup assume that one has no money and treat you but. Definitely not going back and wouldn't recommend it.",

He spoke very disrespectfully, where you can hear Berlin slang. Immediately after dessert we were shooed away by the waiter because they needed the table even though there were plenty of other tables.\n\nOverall, Grill Royal needs to seriously improve its service. Even the best food can't make up for feeling undervalued as a customer. I won't be returning anytime soon.",
