I see more complaints in the comments.\nOn top of everything, they added two espressos on the bill that we never ordered.‚ùå\n\n*Burger bun- dry, probably a week old‚õîÔ∏è\n*Burger patties- overcooked and tasteless(ordered medium, got well done)‚õîÔ∏è\n*Chorizo sausage- they don‚Äôt even use ‚õîÔ∏èchorizo sausage but Njeguska kobasica. ‚õîÔ∏è\n*French fries- was almost completely cold when it was served. ‚õîÔ∏è\n*Cappuccino was good ‚úÖ\nThe waiter also doesn‚Äôt give a damn, as he approached me twice in the span of 30 minutes to ask ‚Äúhow was everything‚Äù, obviously forgetting that I already told him that we were not satisfied and told him everything that was wrong. They don‚Äôt care.",

Cocktails are great.\n\nThe service was mediocre: 10PM, empty place, but the waiter just passed by with menus at hand, paying no attention to us. I had to stand up and go grab the menus myself. He wasn't friendly and havent said a word when we thanked him for the dinner after paying for it.",

The food is excellent, especially the burgers, and the prices are reasonable. The quality of the ingredients is superb!
