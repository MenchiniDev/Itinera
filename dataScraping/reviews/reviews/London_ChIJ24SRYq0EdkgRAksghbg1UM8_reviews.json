We reported it to reception on our way out for the evening and we were told it would be sorted out by the time we returned. We got back to the hotel at 1130 that night to be told that we still had no hot water and as the hotel was fully booked there was nothing they could do about it!! The only options we had was to have cold showers or feel dirty after a while day walking round Londonâ€¦.not a pleasant experience either way!",

            "text": "Although not too far from stpauls and London city offices, the rooms can vary in quality. A premier plus room can sometimes be quite small, which for the additional price is silly. They do come with a fridge, glass bottled water and better soaps.\n\nIn addition to this, if you're on floor 1, good luck having any sort of view. I felt like I was living in a basement and forgotten about. Which is a step down from the quality I see from other locations of the same brand.\n\nNot to mention, the breakfast is a reasonable quality. But the dinner. I will never eat ever again. Pizza tasted like cardboard.",

Our room was a good size  comfortable beds, the view from the room was awful as it was an overgrown courtyard with rubbish outside the window. Breakfasts was good value for money I would definitely stay here again",
