It is rare to eat such a bad club sandwich in all of Italy! And the girls at the entrance are completely helpful…. And the room prices are unrealistic without corresponding to the level of the room and the services! You pay a fortune for the gardens!!!!!! Choose another hotel!!!",

The hotel itself is beautiful, especially the hidden backyard in which you can escape the noise of the city - it feels like a little oasis, so green and lush and cozy. And then the staff: incredibly attentive and friendly. Every detail is cared for and their hospitality is unmatched. Thank you for a most wonderful stay.",

The garden courtyard is just magical - our only regret is we brought rain to Rome, so couldn't sit in the beautiful courtyard for our dinner.",
