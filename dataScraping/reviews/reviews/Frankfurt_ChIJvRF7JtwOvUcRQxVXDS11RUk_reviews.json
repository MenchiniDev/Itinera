I want to point out 2 individuals that were very service oriented and displayed tremendous work ethic. That is Jan and Jill. They worked the restaurant and bar in the evenings. Those two were tremendous!\n\nDarren",

The facilities were amazing, beds were comfortable and breakfast was really nice. I also enjoyed their great quality gym. It’s better than most 5 star hotels. I enjoyed my stay and I will definitely come back here when I’m back in Frankfurt",
