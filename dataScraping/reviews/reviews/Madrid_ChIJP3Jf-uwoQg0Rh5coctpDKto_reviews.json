            "text": "This place was good but it lacks personality. It caters to an executive type of diners. The food was good and their lunch menu wasn't too expensive. But there are more vibrant places (Santoku ðŸ˜‰) on this budget.\n\nIt felt as if though the staff were the ones filling the place and not the other guests. The timing of the servers wasn't all that good either. They removed the plates too quickly and were a bit invasive.\n\nOn a positive note. Kudos to the waiter who modified our order for us.\n\nThey could also use some fresh menus and good Oshibori (hand wipes).  Their bar area needs a touch up. It was uninviting and cluttered.\n\nUnless you're in the area for lunchtime. I wouldn't recommend this place that much.",

The suprise highlight, however, was the simple grilled eggplant with red miso paste. Just divine. Service was professional and friendly, albeit they keep forgetting to refill our water since they were so busy. Cake with candle request was easily catered for with no fuss. A class act in every sense of hospitality. Arigato gazaimas.",
