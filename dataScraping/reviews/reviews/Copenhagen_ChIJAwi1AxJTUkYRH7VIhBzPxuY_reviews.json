The staff there are also so nice and supportive - it was really lovely.\nThe breakfast is a MUST TRY. It's absolutely delicious and full of freshly homemade stuff, and the room is very nice where you eat. Seriously recommend getting the breakfast too.\nThe hotel and rooms are very grand, and a touch older, so keep that in mind I suppose. But I really recommend this one. I also recommend getting married in Denmark :)",

It give a little worn down vibe in the lobby and with some of the furniture inside the rooms - I am sure that can be easily fixed. Staff was throughout friendly, helpful and professional. We didnâ€™t try the breakfast - so we can not comment on that. We would absolutely stay here again - mainly for the location - you can literally walk to any good restaurant in the city center.",

The air conditioning was not working and only one elevator was running. Water was cut off at night, and my room had no hot water for one day. The final morning, there was ONLY hot water. This is a beautiful and historic building that needs investment from Scandic to reach its potential.",

The AC is outdated. The views are bad unless you get an upgrade. The gym is tiny. Also you might hear fireworks from tivoli or just drunk people outside.\n\nOverall good hotel but for the price I was expecting a bit better.",
