The service is excellent, and the cuisine is very Norwegian-oriented, which I appreciate. In a city like Oslo, known for its international flair, it can be challenging to find elevated Norwegian food.",

I got the 7-course and wine pairing and my partner got the vegetarian 5-course and pairing. The vegetarian tasting menu was not an afterthought and felt just as much a main event as the regular menu- an incredible rarity in the world of fine dining. Service was awesome. Just a world-class experience all-around.",

If I come back to Oslo this will be on my list of places to revisit.",
