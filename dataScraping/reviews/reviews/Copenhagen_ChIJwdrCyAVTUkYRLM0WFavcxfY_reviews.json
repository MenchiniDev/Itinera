            "text": "I visited a restaurant in Copenhagen, right next to my hotel, and had a wonderful experience. Initially, I went at night and enjoyed a strong and pleasant drink. The staff was really helpful, and they even offered free Wi-Fi and outdoor seating. The ordering process was simple, and they served the food directly to the table.\n\nThe next morning, I returned for a meal and tried their omelette with harissa sauce and bacon from the brunch menu. The food was delicious, and the coffee was decent. Overall, it's a cozy place with great food and drinks, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Copenhagen.",

Sophisticated and yet honest. Simple and yet very surprising. The service is very friendly and competent. Thank you. We are looking forward to next time.",
