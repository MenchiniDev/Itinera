There are no words to describe the shrimp carpaccio, even if the crêpe filled with mushrooms and black truffle was just a dream. Thank you Rafa and the whole team for a wonderful experience!!",

You could pay a lot more for food that isn't half as good.\n\nAnd the owners took pity on me and my minimal Spanish and chatted with me in French, which gave me a faint chance of knowing what I was ordering.\n\nMy highlight of my trip, dining-wise. Don't hesitate to give it a try.",
