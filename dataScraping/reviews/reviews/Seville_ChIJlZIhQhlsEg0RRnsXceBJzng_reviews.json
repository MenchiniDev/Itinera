We ordered the large prawns for a treat but he bought out 2 plates claiming he thought we wanted 2 portions as we had pointed to a table of 6 people to say we wanted the same as on that table. He bought us 2 large plates for 2 people. We asked why we would order so much he just said it wasn‚Äôt his fault. The prawns were Luke warm and unpleasant to eat and we felt a bit sick after eating g them. The rest of the food was ok but over priced. The worst thing was the appalling attitude of the waiter. He basically ripped us off and was rude to other tourists also. Please avoid and go to place next door, it was far better.",

Good food and good vibes all around.\nTry the fish and the seafood, fresh, extremely well cooked and tasty.\nThe place is not pricy at all and the inside is as beautiful as the outside sitting if you happen to go on a rainy day in Sevilla (quite unlikely though)",
