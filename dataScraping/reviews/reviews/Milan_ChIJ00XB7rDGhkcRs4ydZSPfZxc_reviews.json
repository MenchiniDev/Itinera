The beds are incredibly comfy, ensuring a restful night's sleep. While the rooms are on the smaller side and could benefit from a more modern update, and more bathroom hooks would be appreciated, the overall experience is delightful. I highly recommend it for a pleasant stay in Milan",

Hotel staff were lovely, upgraded us to a wonderful room that even had a terrace (too cold and too brief a stay to use), but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I hope they have improved the restaurant as immediate area restaurants are not as plentiful, but beautiful luxury shops decorated for Christmas season. Would absolutely stay again.",

Impeccable rooms and not intrusive service, super location (surprisingly very very quiet while being in the center!). Will get back. Thank you team!",

The service is also the fastest I’ve ever experienced. This is definitely the nicest 4 star I’ve ever stayed in. Easy to valet park if needed. Excellent coffee and breakfast. Air conditioning works incredibly well. It’s also very quiet inside.",

The hotel is very well kept and what I would call \"old world\" style. The staff are outstanding, offering great suggestions for dinner and even booking reservations for us. We had a great stay!",
