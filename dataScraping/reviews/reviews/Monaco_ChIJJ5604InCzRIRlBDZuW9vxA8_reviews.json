After this, the manager came to us asking to leave and claiming that we disrespected the place. After we agreed to order food, so that we don’t need to leave (it was raining), she called another waitress, for them to both start shouting at us, threatening to call police, as my son held the cookie. Disgusting behaviour. PLEASE READ OTHER REVIEWS WHICH ALSO SPEAK THE TRUTH - NEVER VISIT THIS PLACE.",

We ordered a coffee which was done as a takeaway so we offered to the manager (fairly) to pay extra 2 euros so that we can stay, as she came to us claiming that we misbehaved. Although fine by itself, the lady came shouting at us again, asking to leave the place when my bf took a bite of his sandwich. She kicked us out and threw the empty cup at me as I was leaving the place. Disrespectful and horribly awful service of the customers.",

We ordered a salad with smoked salmon but it was something that seemed to be made by a 2 year-old with learning disabilities. The service was also abysmal, the waitress was extremely rude and arrogant. Additionally, the prices are ridiculous considering you get some packaged lettuce, tomatoes, pineapple and salmon which you can buy in the store for around 3 euros but alas, they charge you 14 whole euros. The grapefruit was dated from last year I think since it smelled and tasted like the streets of London. At least the toilet wasn’t a hole in the ground which is the only reason this review is one star and not 0. Just because you work at a restaurant in Monte Carlo does not make it ok for you to serve garbage and be rude to customers.\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk.",
