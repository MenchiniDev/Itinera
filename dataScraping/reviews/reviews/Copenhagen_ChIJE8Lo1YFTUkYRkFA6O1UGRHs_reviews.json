Kids play area in the restaurant. We had a family room for 4 plus a free cot to fit all 5 of us in. Breakfast was good but no bacon or standard beans, though plenty to choose from. We stayed 9 nights to make the most of trips out.",

Rooms are modern, clean and functional but maybe a little small. A big advantage is the great breakfast which is literally free for you. Staff is very friendly and of course English speaking.",

Very clean rooms, large areas, conference center, spacious gym, separate saunas for males and females,  open rooftop to rest and catch the city areal view etc.\n\nThe very large reception area compliments the warm welcome of the great services of the personnels with special mention of and appreciation to Million.\n\nThis hotel is unique in many ways such as free parking and you even have electric charging points available.\n\nBe aware this hotel has no refrigerators or tea/coffee/microwave in the rooms which was a down side for me.",
