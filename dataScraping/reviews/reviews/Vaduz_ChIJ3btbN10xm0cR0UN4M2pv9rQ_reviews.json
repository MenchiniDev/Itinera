            "text": "Really Top experience.\nStaff very friendly and attentive.\nDishes fresh, good quality of products, you have two option to choose size the main dishes. Smaller and a litte cheaper are nice if you are not very hungry and you take before some soup or you planned take same dessert.\nIf you are hungry big portion are really good and fair price for the service and quality in this country :) The best risotto ever.\nVery beautiful decorated. It's not very touristic restaurant so it's possible find some table if you are lucky without make reservation , in the time when we stay most of people stay in business lunch. But definitely it's very good experience and we hope come back in next year.\nHigh recommend!",

            "text": "Mediocre food, very inattentive staff. Had to wait to be seated in a nearly empty restaurant. The waiters were very rude towards us, maybe because we are tourists but we had a large order with wine. They were bias towards us, other guests were treated more politely. Empty plates were taken only after 15 minutes even though the waiters noticed them. We were asked if everything was OK but when we said not really, the waiters did not follow up to ask us what we did not like, instead they talked about us to each other and looked at us unpleasantly. This is unacceptable in a restaurant of a higher than average class.",
