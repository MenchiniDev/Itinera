We ate at the restaurant twice, first on Saturday night for the gourmet experience, which was superb and memorable (beetroot mousse! the celeriac starter! the pigeon!) and second, on Sunday night, for the less starry “bistro” service, which was also delicious (the lamb stew tortella omg). Both nights Sergei and Nicole tended to our every need with engaging good humour and warmth. Thank you!",

Solved my problems at night when I was out of shower gel. And she got the sense of humour that help me to ease the pressure with a big family.\nThe scenery of the hotel was superb. The excellent breakfast was a must too. The best banana croissant we had in italy(probably Europe? Personally) With $1600hkd per night got this level of quality, I would recommend all people to have your breakfast here when you stay. ( same price in Milan we only got quality half of here)\n\nThe manager Nicola in restaurant helped for our 3 days stay. The young waiters who I didn’t know the name were helpful too. Best service in our stay in Italy.",

The hotel staff go above and beyond to make your stay the best possible. The restaurant food was delicious, it’s a must try during your stay. They have a bus stop outside which takes you right into Florence, or Fiesole in the other direction. We can’t wait to return!",
