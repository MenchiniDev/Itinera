Even after 15y(?).\n\nLoved the server, loved the atmosphere, loved the food, loved the people visiting.\n\nWe had two entrees and two mains, together with two servings of bread. As the sitter was leaving early, we did not manage dessert. but these also looked great from afar.",

Each dish is beautifully served, tastes amazing and all ingredients work very well with each other. Each bite is a celebration. The staff also do their best to make the visit an unforgettable experience. Amazing overall quality for a reasonable price. This is definitely a „must visit” in Tallinn!",

This place turned out to be such a beautiful experience that I recommend everyone to visit atleast once. Single page of menu, which should definitely contain something for your liking, Drinks menu is vast, from local Vana Tallinn to imported Wines. Overall decor is modern, with decent space. And on top of it, staff was awesomely warm. Great place.",

We had the pickles with honey, the Siberian dumplings and chicken Kiev, along with a bottle of Soave. The food was very good, and there are definitely more items on the menu that I would like to try. The service was the weak point, we didn’t feel welcomed and didn’t get any support or recommendations with the menu. We actually wish we had the server that was taking care of the table next to us because she was so attentive and helpful!",
