We were extremely pleased and relieved with the level of care paid to celiac clients: the menu is clearly marked for gluten (there's also a gluten free only menu) and the items are flagged when they arrive at the table. The restaurant is rightfully accredited by the Celiac Association of Spain!",

I wouldn’t say it’s the “best Thai I have ever had”, however I do acknowledge that they are limited with providing full flavors compared to what is found throughout the world in the Thai cuisine. I would recommend overall especially if you have a Thai craving",

The food tastes delicious, but a little bit too simple for my taste, I loved the weirder dishes such as the beef triangles, but other more conventional dishes such as pastas with vegetables or rice were too simple and normal-tasting for their price tag.\nIn the pictures there are beef and a mango dessert",
