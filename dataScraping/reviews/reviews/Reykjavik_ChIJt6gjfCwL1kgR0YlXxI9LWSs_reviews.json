            "text": "Our favourite place that we tried in Reykjavik, food was reasonably priced, especially considering how good everything was. The waitress was very kind and friendly, we really wanted to meet locals and she entertained a small chat with us, which we really enjoyed. Onto the main event, the food: oh wow! We loved the duck breast starter, some flavours I would have never thought to put together but they worked soooo well! Definitely not a dish I would be able to recreate, which is exactly what left me wanting more and is going to make me go back to Iceland for it. We loved the wolf fish as well as the fish of the day (which was cod). Everything blended together beautifully, flavours were top notch. If that place was in the UK, I'd return every week. In terms of value per money, this was the most affordable dinner that we had in Reykjavik, and the price:quality ratio was unmatched! Highly recommend. Also this was the one place where we noticed the most diversity in staff, which we liked!",
