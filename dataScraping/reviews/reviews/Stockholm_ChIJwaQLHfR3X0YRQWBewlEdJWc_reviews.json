Watching the traffic of vehicles entering the tunnel under the hotel while h√§vning breakfast.\n\nThey have a great complete breakfast buffet. Samuel welcomed us very warmly and visited us several times if we needed anything that we might not have found in the buffet. Thank you üôè\n\nWe will definitely come back to stay and enjoy a weekend there one day.",
