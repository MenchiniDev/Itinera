She went above and beyond to ensure I received the help I needed, arranging for a private doctor to visit me in my room and even organizing the pickup of my medication from a local pharmacy.\n\nHer genuine care and swift action made an incredibly stressful situation so much easier to handle. Barbara is truly a credit to the hotel, and her dedication to guest well-being deserves special recognition.",

            "text": "Lobby and 0 floor corridors leading to restaurants tastefully and elegantly decorated. Restaurants had good ambience, and quality if not outstanding food. Restaurant service quick and efficient but a bit abrupt. Restrooms clean and befitting a 5 star hotel.\n\nRooms were found in dated, narrow corridors showing some age and separated into different wings. Inside the rooms, everything seemed to be in good order and clean and newer than the corridors. My single room was a bit small for a 4⭐️hotel. Acoustics were bad and I could hear comings and goings the whole night.\n\nSafe, kettle, coffee fixings and mini fridge with complimentary still and sparkling water welcomed guests to the room with enough space to hang clothes.\n\nLocation was good to see the major sights in Florence. It’s a 15 minute walk or about 2500 steps to Starbucks, the Florence Cathedral, Baptistry, Piazza Michelangelo, Giotto’s Bell Tower",

Made the visit not as nice as we would have liked. I guess the Italian government mandated the AC restrictions on October 14 across the board. Not the hotels fault by any means, just would have been nice to have been informed.",
