The AC in the room stopped cooling at random time, we reset it a few times this it was humid inside as it was hot inside.\n\nThe location is close to HBF and few streets around the hotel definitely feels unsafe. There are some highly rated restaurants around too. There are 2 tram stations close by and I used it rather than walk to HBF. I think I will not stay here again for personal reasons.",
