The rooms are spacious and very comfortable and the location is right in the center of Ballsbridge.\nOn the downside, it's a little more expensive than other hotels in this category.",

The staff are very obliging and are knowledgeable about allergens. They even have gluten free bread and toast! Excellent service is provided by all, especially Julio and Gokhan, some of the staff at breakfast. At dinner I wish to acknowledge Vitaly and Julio for making it memorable. This place is a great value for money and I would certainly return here in a heartbeat.",
