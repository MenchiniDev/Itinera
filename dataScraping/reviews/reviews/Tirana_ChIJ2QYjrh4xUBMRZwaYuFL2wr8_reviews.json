            "text": "This hotel was awful. I don't know who gave them 4 stars. The room looked like it needed renovating for 20 years. The glass in the windows was cracked. There were gaps between the windows where the wind was getting into the room. It was too dark inside, even with the lights on. The bathroom was really disgusting. The shower had a cracked shower tray. There was mould everywhere. There were cables sticking out from under the mirror. We got a room on the fourth floor without a lift. The fourth floor looked like an extension. We had to walk in the rain from the staircase to the room. My son fell over on the slippery tiles. The breakfast was poor. The staff barely communicated in English, at least that was the impression they gave by not responding to our greeting. This hotel sucked and I want to forget this unfortunate joke as soon as possible. The standard comparable to a poor category staff hostel. I don't recommend, in fact I would advise against it.",

This time we had dinner in their restaurant, really not recommended.  Also, the water in the room was not hot and the room did not heat up properly.  Not a good experience.\n\nWe have now been to this hotel a few times and I hope that this bad experience is an exception and not a sign of falling standards.",
