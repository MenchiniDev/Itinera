            "text": "Delicious meal with extremely fresh fish! Charming interior and beautiful dishes. Several vegetarian options such as tofu, mushrooms, and vegetable based items. If you eat fish, the salmon is absolutely outstanding, both raw and grilled. We enjoyed dinner here during our visit to Helsinki. Parents were thrilled to eat here and have wanted to try the food since they watched the movie Kamome Diner in 2006. Highly recommend this spot for authentic Japanese food!",

Highly recommended!",

We also had the wasabi potatoes (following another review we read) which were amazing and the tempura veg.\n\nThe service was excellent too.\n\nHighly recommended and would definitely come back if we were staying here longer.",
