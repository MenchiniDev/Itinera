We ordered the fish soup and clamp as a starter and both were amazing. We then got the charr and shrimps. We were a bit surprised that the 300 gram shrimp dish was served cold but the taste was amazing and the portion was quite large.",

The waiter was very busy and he came over to the table constantly to check on us if there was anything we needed.  It has a good reputation for Salmon and Norwegian lobster. They were both delicious.",

The seafood we ordered were all very fresh and juicy and came with amazing flavor. The chef definitely knew how to present each of the dishes perfectly! The dishes were served with a comfortable pace that we all enjoyed.\n\nHighly recommend the beer from the Oslo local brewery Schous! You wonâ€™t be disappointedðŸ˜Œ",

To start with, redfish ceviche with crab crisps, tickles the taste buds, then we get a great coconut soup with shrimps, the main course is a Norwegian specialty, oven-baked salmon served with blue shrimp and celery puree, and a mango dessert, the whole composition combines beautifully together and gives many taste sensations. We don't often come back to the same meals, but on the second visit the choice was the same. Really big applause ðŸ˜Ž",
