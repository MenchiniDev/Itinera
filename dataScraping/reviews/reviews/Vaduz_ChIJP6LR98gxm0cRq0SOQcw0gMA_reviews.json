            "text": "Wasn’t our favorite hotel but sufficient if you understand what you are getting into. The location is really good being only a few minute walk from a large train station.\n\nThe service was fine, nothing spectacular but they held our bags for us and weren’t rude or unfriendly.\n\nThe room was not good. Very small with no air conditioning and very poor circulation. It was cool outside (~18° C/65° F) and the room was probably ~27° C/80° F which was very uncomfortable. No fan in the room or bathroom. We got a small fan from the front desk but that barely helped. We had to have the windows wide open all night and there is a lot of loud car and bus traffic outside.\n\nTo make matters worse we tried to do laundry (which cost 8 CHF!) and the machines were extremely difficult to get working then the washer left our clothes soaking wet which required us to dry multiple times and was still damp. After staying up an hour or two later than we wanted to get our clothes dry we gave up and had to hang them which were still barely dry in the morning.",

Everything was comfortable with the room except there is no AC and it was a bit warm when we were there, but don't think that's too abnormal. Service was friendly and helpful. Short walking distance to many restaurants and bars. Breakfast is OK, nothing special. Would stay here again.",
