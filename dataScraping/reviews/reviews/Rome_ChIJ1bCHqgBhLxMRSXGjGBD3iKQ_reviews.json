They have a nice rooftop that is best at night to view the city lights. We arrived in the morning time from our cruise ship but had to wait until 3pm for our room which we felt was a little too long. Overall we would come back because of the location.",

Like much of Europe, the air conditioning in our room was one of the least powerful ones in a hotel of our 2 week trip, which can be an American specific gripe. The staff was very friendly, and rooms were clean and comfortable!",

The room was old and outdated, which significantly affected the overall comfort of my stay. Additionally, the service provided was below standards, leaving much to be desired in terms of hospitality and attentiveness.\n\nWhile it was a nice gesture to receive complimentary champagne, it did little to offset the other issues. Perhaps the most unbelievable aspect was that the hotel turns off the air conditioner from 2 AM to 6 AM. This was extremely uncomfortable and unthinkable for a hotel that aims to provide a pleasant stay for its guests.\n\nI would strongly reconsider staying here, as there are undoubtedly better options available that offer more modern amenities and superior service.",
