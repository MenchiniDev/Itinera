All written in  italian but we figured enough to know we would find something we liked.\nWe were seated with a menu that had English notes and picked out choices.  The staff had made recommendations and the ordering began.\n\nWe had drinks, starter, sides and main.  All very reasonably priced.\n\nYum all the way thru.\nWe have really enjoyed the local dining.  Such a lovely experience.\nüáÆüáπ‚ù§Ô∏èüáÆüáπ‚ù§Ô∏è",

We ate the pasta that was the specialty of the restaurant and it was amazing. The squid, prawns and escalope with lemon sauce were delicious too. The point of improvement, to me, is the service. Despite not being rude at all, we did have to call the waitress every time to change the plates, make an order, order more wine, get the next course, etc. They were not bad, just not really proactive.",
