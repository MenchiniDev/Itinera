If you feel like you had a long day sightseeing and don‚Äôt want to walk anymore, the hotel‚Äôs Ristorante Francy has amazing food! A hidden gem.\nThe staff is incredibly friendly and helpful - Alessandra is just lovely! She makes a mean martini üòÅ and the bar area is a great place to unwind after a day of sightseeing.\nI won‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again!",

The hotel is not responding to email/phone calls, then charges you full price for \"no show\", without notification.\n\nI emailed the hotel, more than once, 10 days prior to our booking date (free cancellation is valid 48 hours prior to booking date), still no response, as well as on the phone. Now they charged my credit card for full price.\n\nI highly recommend not to book at all, but if you do - only from a trusted booking site. Beware!",

Most important walking distance to the best places in Florence: cathedral, gallery, square... you don't need taxi to reach those famous touristic places, just 10-15 min walk, amazing. Definitely coming back",
