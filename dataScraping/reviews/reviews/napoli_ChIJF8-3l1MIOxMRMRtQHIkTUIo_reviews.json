The famous pitsa margarita was very good but it was the same as all the other places I tasted it. In conclusion, where ever you eat in Napoli, it's gonna be good. I would definitely recommend this place while you visit Naples.",

            "text": "I loved visiting this pizzeria given its history as the place with the chef who invented the Margherita pizza for the Queen! It didn't seem easy to book online so we just went there just before they opened in the evening, and put our name down for a table for 4 people. We didn't wait long and sat on a table outside. Lovely atmosphere and delicious pizza!!\nOnly criticism would be that the musicians are in your face and will demand tips which I didn't particularly like. I think their music is nice so maybe the restaurant should pay them a fee to play nearby as opposed to right at your table.\nI'd happily go back though, really loved the place and the pizza.",

They do have musicians popping in to play live music (and then asking for tips), which I personally do not prefer (I enjoy nice, intimate, quiet dinner which allows easy conversation) but some people find it enjoyable.",
