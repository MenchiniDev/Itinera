My only suggestion is too work on the way the food is presented - it looks dreadful and it's a pity because it's much better than the presentation would suggest",

            "text": "I have to say was really shocked, how bad pizza it was.... My friend bought pizza grab and go for 3,5 BGN on the street and seems better that this big one for 21 BGN i had... I ordered big but the plate was smaller than the pizza and taste like cake, the dough is not good. The quality is like fast food, not restaurant. The pizza was burned. I can do at home better pizza - see my pictures attached -  than this one and put also my picture to see the difference. I wish to all of them good business but i was unsatisfied and will never come again. Pls show my picture also the cooker and explain him do not use form for pizza. Nice day\n\nMissing paper towl on the table",

My main criterion was to find a place where people did not smoke inside the environment and I managed to find Ugo. The menu is vast and explains well the options in English, in addition to highlighting those that are vegetarian - which makes the tourist’s life much easier. I ordered a vegetarian dish, very tasty, and a pizza. We were well attended and the space is quite large. I’d be back.",
