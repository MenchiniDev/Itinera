When she wasn’t busy she told us a bit about the place and city which was very interesting and helpful.\nFood was delicious and the kolsh was served in the traditional way.\nGood experience for tourists and seemed popular with locals too.\nIt is huge so probably gets crazy busy at peak times.",

Upon entering, the staff seemed aloof… ok… is that introduction to what rudeness is? But OMG… things just went the opposite! We had the sweetest server Sebastian Krause ⭐️. He was very patient, super efficient in topping up our beers and letting his colleagues know that we were not done with our pork knuckles - which were tasty. Fried poratoes were coated with bacon bits which made it yummier. I guess politeness will get you politeness! Thank you Sebastian!",
