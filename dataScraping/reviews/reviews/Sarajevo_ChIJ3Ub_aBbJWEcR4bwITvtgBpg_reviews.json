Four of us ordered food, we ordered quite a lot, the restaurant is five minutes away from our location and still the food was totally cold, tasted weird and the portions were tiny (picture of the grilled vegetable portion size attached). Their food is not cheap and the value for money just isn‚Äôt worth it",

Wi-Fi is included and location is veryconvenient.  It's nearby the \"Socijalno\" tram station. Outside seating is also possible. Pleasant service as well is somewhat of a standard there.",
