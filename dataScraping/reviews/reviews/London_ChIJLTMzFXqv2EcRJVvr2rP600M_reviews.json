The menu has plenty of choice and is not overpriced for London. The Meal Deal is recommended. The staff were very pleasant and helpful.",

We declined and placed out bags in the storage room.\n\nThe restaurant was closed so breakfast was available quite close but we had meetings so didn't have the breakfast, instead starbucks had a hammering directly opposite.\n\nRooms are cold but the heating is amazing and heats up really good.  Great location and I would stay here again",

            "text": "While in an excellent location the Hotel itself was a disappointment. Beginning with lifting heavy luggage up stairs into reception where we were met with a couple of self serve check in machines. Reception has absolutely no soul and not a single chair to sit down on to relax or wait for your transport.\nEventually a staff member appeared as there were several people waiting.\nAnother irritating thing is you need a staff member to open both male & female toilets unless you have your room key with you. The wait for this can be very long as staff are usually busy doing other things.\nThe room was ok, clean however the bed was extremely uncomfortable. Also you had to speak to staff before 12 if you were wanting your room refreshed. In saying this I felt sorry for the staff as they seemed to be pulled in many different directions and still managed to be helpful & polite.\nWe took the breakfast/dinner meal deal a few times and were happy and thought it was well priced. We enjoyed both dinner & breakfasts.\nThe location suited us but we would most likely not stay here again.",
