            "text": "We enjoyed our stay at the Nobis during our visit to Stockholm.\n\nWe arrived early and luckily we did not wait long for our room, as the staff were welcoming and accommodating.\nThe hotel lobby, bar, lounge, and amenity spaces are quite beautiful, and breakfast was good.\nThe rooms are clean and well appointed, though on the cozy side. I didn't snap a picture of our room, but the pictures on the website show them off well.\nFinally, the location is fantastic, in the center of Stockholm and close to many great sites, restaurants, shopping, and the central train station. If we have the pleasure of visiting Stockholm again, we will certainly stay at the Nobis Hotel.",

But cabinets and bathroom are well organized and the lounge, reception, cafe, gym are all excellent.  Location is superb - near shopping. Water and boat tours .   Very nice contemporary decoration",

Our room was a bit small and looked into an interior courtyard, so there was not much natural daylight. The hotel's location is excellent.\nIf you get a chance, ride the vintage tram to get a feel for this city.",

            "text": "Definitely not a five star hotel. Maybe a 3 star at best. Our room had a very strange layout with minimal lighting. Only one elevator to our side of the building which faced the park and Berg Building. The elevator wait time was unsatisfactory. At night the club in the Berg building played extremely loud DJ music starting at 11pm and lasting until 4am. We could not sleep for two consecutive nights. No wonder the hotel had earplugs as an amenity. Good buffet breakfast though and a nice central location, except for the nightclub across the street. But for the very high price we paid, For  I do not recommend this hotel. Very disappointed.",
