            "text": "The worst hotel I've ever stayed at in Vienna especially for the price. I had a hard time sleeping because they was a party in the courtyard past midnight. There were no holidays whatsoever.\n\nI didn't mind that the room was tiny but the wall paint, the giant lamp at the center, and just how everything was setup did not look good at all. The wifi is also unstable, the next day it stopped working at all. Beware of the vault in the room. My device fit in well when I first put it in so I was surprised that when I opened the vault to take it out, there was a resistance. Turns out there was a long rod inside and my device got chipped.\n\nThe breakfast was disappointing. I also had lunch and ordered bistek. It was the most sour bistek I've ever had and for a small serving, it was €19. It wasn't a big problem since I couldn't finish it because of its taste anyway.",

The rooms and windows open into the courtyard. On summer nights, the locals like to party at the bar until midnight. Perfect if you want to socialize but not great if you like to sleep before midnight. Even with the windows closed, it was not easy to sleep.\n\nOtherwise very friendly staff and perfectly clean and cute rooms.\n\nProbably a better option in cooler seasons when the courtyard is quiet.",
