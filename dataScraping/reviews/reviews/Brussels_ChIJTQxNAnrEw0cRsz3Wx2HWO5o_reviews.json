Good service and very good wine selection.\n\nThe food was simply unbelievable. All dishes were specifically created. It took us back to Hungary with the vinegar infused vegetables. To Greece with the Rouget and the venison was cooked perfectly. As for the dessert, the apple (hide and seek version) blow our mind!\n\nA very good experience overall. A bit pricey for the food but worth the stop!",

            "text": "It‚Äôs not common for a Michelin-starred tasting menu to have consistently delicious food served from start to finish, but I personally enjoyed every dish that came out of Comme Chez Soi‚Äôs 5-dish tasting menu.\n\nThe restaurant‚Äôs name is translated as ‚ÄúJust Like Home‚Äù in English, with hopes of bringing Belgian home cooking to a higher, more refined standard.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the multicolored tomatoes with basil Granito to start and both the Hamachi, Abalone, and Wild Mushrooms as well as the Challandais Duck for main.\n\nI‚Äôm not usually a fan of cherry and chocolate, but the dessert served here (warm, cold, and room temp) was heavenly.\n\nIt‚Äôs pricey for sure at ‚Ç¨175 for 5-courses, I‚Äôll probably recommend going for the 6 course menu at ‚Ç¨200 for better value. I believe you are getting 2-Michelin starred dining here (having only lost one of its stars in 2022) as the dishes were on par pr better that some of the 2-Michelin starred placed I‚Äôve been to.\n\nOn top of that, this is a restaurant with so much history that I‚Äôm glad I made the trip. It‚Äôs my best meal in Brussels!",

This is due to Comme Chez Soi not really reaching the heights of Nathan Antwerp or Hert Turnhout. But it‚Äôs a must when it comes to fine dining in Brussels . I‚Äôm not disappointed!",
