            "text": "What a “wow” factor when you walk in. The entrance with the marble stairs and a small forest of freshly cut flowers really is something. It’s elegance encapsulated in a hotel. Very nice greeting from staff (the first interaction at a hotel is massively important to me. It can literally make or break a stay.) Lunch in the restaurant was fantastic - I had the special which was a porcini mushroom risotto. Not sure my arteries enjoyed it but absolutely every other part of me did. Room was nicely furnished and quiet. I’m told the owner is very hands on here and it shows (in a good way.)",

            "text": "I was a happy and lucky guest of the Spa at Palazzo Parigi. I like spas of great hotels and have seen several. Trust me if I tell you this was so far the best one in Milano. For many reasons: a very caring and human service, a great attention for details and stylistic identity. Just a few examples: I took a massage treatment: a high quality one, and shifting from body to face area to treat the lady washed her hands and changed oil, much lighter and fresh. There is an area where you can sit and drink teas, waters and eat fruit or dry fruit. The area of the spa is inspired by Middle East culture and gives you the felling of relax and well being. Definitely recommended",

Thank god we have our own insurance and everything was resolved.  Ironically Madonna stayed at this hotel the same week.  I bet if her jewelry was stolen the hotel would have reacted in a more professional manner.",
