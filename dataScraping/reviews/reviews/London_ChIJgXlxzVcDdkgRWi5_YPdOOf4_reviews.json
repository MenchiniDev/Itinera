I travel a lot and usually stay in higher end hotels but the staff at this location gave 5 star service at a more affordable price. The bed was very comfortable as well, would recommend.",

            "text": "A great place to stay for central London. The prices aren’t high, and it’s great value if you have children because you can get family rooms rather than two rooms like a lot of hotels.\n\nThe location is amazing. 5min walk from Tate Modern, Round the corner from The Globe, and next door to Borough Market. Loads of restaurants and bars along the Thames. The Southbank is about a 15min walk away.\n\nBreakfast was the usual Premier Inn buffet. The room was a little small but didn’t seem too crowded. Very relaxed actually.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and helpful. If you arrive a bit early you can leave your bags. They even offered to store them for a while after we checked out.\n\nAll in all great value. I’d definitely stay here again if I needed somewhere central.",

The pillows were compressed to flat, hard cakes. The people were good and breakfast was amazing value - complete with vegan bacon and vegan sausages",
