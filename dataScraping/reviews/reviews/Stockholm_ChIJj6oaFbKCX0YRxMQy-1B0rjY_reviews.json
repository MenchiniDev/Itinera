            "text": "I booked this place after seeing high reviews on booking.com. Firstly, the hotel staff were very nice and accommodating to my requests, but I wanted to write a review about the hotel itself. My stars go to their kindness and hospitality. However, this hotel was not for me and did not justify the price. Upon arrival, I was informed that there would be a cycling competition happening the next day with loud music outside the hotel and lots of people coming in on site. There was also a wedding party in the hotel that night, which ended around 12:30 am. If you are looking for a quiet, serene stay, you might need to check with the hotel to see if there are any events happening during your stay.\n\nThe breakfast lacked quality - instant coffee, no black tea, the orange juice had gone bad (they replaced when I notified) the muesli was stale, no unsweetened yogurt, and the cucumbers and tomatoes looked dry. I didn‚Äôt see any cheese options other than brie and cottage cheese. The bread didn‚Äôt have much flavor, and there was no fish.\n\nThe location is great, with a garden view close to the Nordic Museum, √ñstermalm, and T-Centralen. However, this is not a boutique hotel where everything is prepared with love and care.",

Rooms are spacious with great AC and WiFi.  Restaurant service was excellent.  Front desk was not very helpful on a couple of occasions, thus dropping off a star for service.  Would stay here again the sure.",
