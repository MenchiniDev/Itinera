Marina Botel was superb, the staff were very helpful, the room was always warm after a November day out, the breakfast was marvellous. As for location, you couldn't wish for better. Set by the bridge & close to the old town. Would definitely use again next time we visit Bratislava.",

            "text": "It's a lovely idea, putting s charismatic 100 year old Louisiana oil steamer on the Danube and making it s hotel. And it could be done really well. Unfortunately in my cabin, the TV didn't work, it smelled of cigarettes, the curtains didn't block any light or give me privacy and I didn't find the beds comfortable. Also, the river was in full flow,candidate at times the groaning from the boat sounded like the iron moorings were slipping. The staff are lovely, though and it is a unique experience. Very reasonably priced too, which is why there were no complaints from me.",

The view was serene (ask for a riverside room), and breakfast was decent. Moreover, the staff are very nice. We forgot a souvenir in our room. They were nice enough to mail it all the way to the UK. In the end they wrote off the cost. We are very grateful.",

Love this place and definitely come back.",

            "text": "Front desk staff were very nice. The rooms were small, but clean. The biggest issue for us is that currently, there is construction on the sidewalk immediately outside of the hotel. On weekdays, you have to navigate around construction workers, vehicles, and wet cement. Bringing luggage through this was very difficult. This is not a reflection on the hotel, but I would avoid booking a hotel on the river until the construction is over.",
