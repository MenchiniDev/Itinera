You would think its a new fresh one but that ain't true.\nDue to this you can't really settle in your room as you would desire.\n\nThe interior is simple but great.\n\nWhen it comes to the breakfast. I was a little disappointed. It has the basics but if you are not a pork eater you won't have much choice. On the other hand they have a fun thing on details like a small bread basket or a little bowl for fruit (they have multiple fruit options).\n\nThe location of the hotel is great. Its really close to public transportation. Around a 7 minute walk.",
