            "text": "Bare minimum is what describes this place the best. A room with a bad and a small heater (the heater could have been bigger than the small one we had in our room, literally it was the smallest heater I've ever seen). The toilets were most of the time clean and the same for the showers. They clean them 5 times/day at scheduled hours. Towels are 2 euro each, a decent price I would say. They have a shared kitchen and shared lounge area at the reception. It is not close to the city center, but it is an 8-minute walk to a metro station with a direct line to it. For the money we spent I think it paid off.",

There were no hand towels or hand dryers. If you get up to pee during the night, I don't recommend getting the rooms in the back because they are far from the bathrooms. Apart from that, the place is fine, cubes are cute, guests mind their own businesses.",

            "text": "We stayed 5 nights here and were overall pleased with our visit. Our experience were vastly different from some previous reviewers. The toilets and showers were almost always super clean and I often saw staff cleaning them, at least on the ladies' side. Cleaning staff was very friendly and let me use newly cleaned showers even though she wasn't finished cleaning the other ones. Room service would have been appreciated at least once during our stay.\nStaff in the reception gave off a less service minded impression, but aside from seeming disinterested in their job we had no trouble at all with them.\nThe outdoor pool facility next door was a welcome neighbor during hot summer days, but also meant a lot of loud noises during the day.\nThe room/cube itself was very simple and ours did not have any wifi. It was overall difficult to connect to the wifi no matter where I was. The beds were clean and comfy. Our cube was quite ugly, but most of the other ones were pretty looking.\nBook your room through their own website to get a better price.",

The one we stayed in had no shade and in 30 degree summer weather it was unbearable even with the fan on. The facilities are over by the reception area and it was a far walk from the room. This would have been nice to know in advance as this probably would have altered my booking decision. There are only a few bathrooms and showers available and during our stay they were not very clean, also half of the showers have doors and the others only have a shower curtain. One of the nights there were people sleeping in the hallway which didn't feel ok.",
