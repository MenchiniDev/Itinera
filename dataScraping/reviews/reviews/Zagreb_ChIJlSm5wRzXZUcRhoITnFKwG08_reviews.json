We will be back for sure!",

            "text": "Dissapointing experience. The black ink rissoto was nice but the veel was accompanied by a very strong and thick I guess mushroom puree (there is an unhealthy obsession in the Zagreb fine dining scene with purees) with touches of pomelo? that was just unpleasant and incongruous with the meat. The fish was combined with a sweet puree (similar problem in Zinfandel, did the chefs study in the same school?) which just doesn't work well with fish. The desert was ok but not on the level it should be I guess if they want to catch that elusive michelin star. Service was great. Price not too high.\n\nEDIT: Wow, they just got the michelin star for 2024. What a load of crock. Michelin is really eroding it's credibility as a fine dining guide.",

We tried the chef's course, and were very satisfied trying all the different courses that were planned.  The dishes are prepared in a very modern style, and the presentation on the dishes was quite enticing.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a fancy night out!",
