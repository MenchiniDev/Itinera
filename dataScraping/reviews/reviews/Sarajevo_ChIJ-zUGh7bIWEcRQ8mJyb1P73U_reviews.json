I left my wallet in the room and it was in my backpack, I didn’t check when I checked out to see if I have all the money and I notice it too late when I was out of the city. I called the hotel some random staff answered and when I told him the issue he suddenly forgot how to speak in English. Also we request to speak with the manager and he said to call another day and hangout. We called from\nAnother phone and apparently we spoke with the manager and all he could say was: you should look after your money and I know all my employees, they wouldn’t do this. He said that he will have a meeting with them the next day and he will revert with an answer but he never did….",
