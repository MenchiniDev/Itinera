            "text": "So, we've stayed at Hotel Podgorica, and it was basically the best experience a low-budget hotel can give you.\nBig, spacious room with a king-size bed, a sofa, and two balconies.\n\nPros:\n1. Very quiet location.\n2. Relatively close to the airport (14 minutes drive)\n3. As said, huge rooms.\n4. There are lots of food options for breakfast.\n5. Free parking spots\n6. Friendly staff.\n7. Clothes washing service is available.\n8. The room cleaning service is fast and professional.\n\nCons:\n1. No elevator!\n2. Both balconies, which were detailed as \"view to the river,\" did not have a view to the river. All you can see are trees that are blocking the river's view.\n3. The rooms are looking relatively old-looking.\n4. The shower has a hot tube capability, but the wire that connects the shower's head is just noisy and not user-friendly.\nAlso on that matter - the handles for cold and hot water are really annoying, it's either hot or cold, not both.\n5. When we've asked for coffee on breakfast, we had to wait more than 20 minutes + asking two staff members for it. Weird.\n6. Having two balconies, yet, smoking is prohibited. I'm not a smoker, but that's not ao fair.",

They were very helpful to provide a smaller room on the date I needed accommodation, but for the same price as the larger room. Even though I explained the situation, they charged me for the date booked my mistake as well and would not answer my messages related to this issue. Almost no parking spaces. Bathroom utilities broken. Carpet on the floor filthy. Old and dirty furniture.\nThe refusal of answering the messages from a client is a blatant lack of respect.",

Delicious. Atmosphere is great and calm. Parking lot should be little bigger but it is what it is. Lady on reception is very kind and was willing to explain everything. Breakfast in the morning is excellent.\nWill probably come back again.",
