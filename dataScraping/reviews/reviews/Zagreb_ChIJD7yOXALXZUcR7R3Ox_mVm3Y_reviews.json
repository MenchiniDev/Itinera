Be aware that you have to order a side dish for the main dishes, so it ends up being a bit expensive. The ravioli with spinach was ok but a bit small portion size. The seafood risotto was good.",

All were excellent and I left feeling stuffed. I arrived quite early but they let me have a drink in the bar before seating me in the restaurant. The staff were really friendly and made me feel very welcome. I was the only person there (it was a Monday lunchtime) but I am sure it gets busy in the evening.",
