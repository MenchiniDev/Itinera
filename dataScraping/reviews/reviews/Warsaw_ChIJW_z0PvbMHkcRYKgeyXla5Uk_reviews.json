They had old-school live music.\nWe had potato sausage as a starter. Interesting and tasty.\nThe duck came without any sauce. It was new to me but still a good dish.\nThe zander war a very good choice.\nIn the restaurant you will see all kinds of locals. Students in groups and also older couples as well as families.\nHighly recommended.",

Kind, friendly and English speaking service. Can't leave the tip on credit.\nMeals:\nKiszka Ziemniaczana (Potato Sausage) - unique and interesting.\nWiejska Kaczka Pieczona (Roasted duck with polish gnocchi) - Real good and filling\nMiod Pitny Dwojniak - Strong ~ 40% but a small 100 ml portion. The taste reminds of vodka and honey",
