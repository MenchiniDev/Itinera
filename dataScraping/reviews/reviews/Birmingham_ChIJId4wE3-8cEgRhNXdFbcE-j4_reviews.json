Food in restaurant was so basic and mostly cold. Mattress in room was terrible and needed replacing as we could feel springs through. And tripping hazards in the morning with laundry in corridors!!! Only nice thing we can say it was a clean hotel mostly and in a reasonable location to city centre.",

All staff were amazing will happy say which room we stayed at do you know who has wrote this",
