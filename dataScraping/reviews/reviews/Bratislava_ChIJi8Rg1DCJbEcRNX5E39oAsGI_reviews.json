Also the room service did not change the sheets and put my used glasses away.\nOther than that Apollo offers everything you need and the breakfast was great.",

            "text": "Ok‚Ä¶trying to be as fair as possible: extra bed for the third person in the room is very expensive at 25 euros/night when they can‚Äôt explain why the ‚Äúthree person rooms‚Äù are not being offered or what the difference is. A bit of a ripoff. The parking is also very expensive at 18 euros/day/car and no discount is given unless a 10 day plus stay when there is street parking much cheaper but not mentioned. The biggest problem is dogs. People lock their animals inside to go to the party and they bark all night long. Once a dog knows there is another dog across the hall they will bark at each other. Then they bring then at the breakfast room with the people. Some dogs poop. I don‚Äôt think they should be allowed there and I love dogs. I went to the desk twice for a dog barking from the next room but nothing happened. You pay to get some rest but it wasn‚Äôt the case. Unfortunately because of this I will not be coming back soon. Otherwise friendly staff, clean rooms, good and varied breakfast, good restaurant food, some with decent prices.",
