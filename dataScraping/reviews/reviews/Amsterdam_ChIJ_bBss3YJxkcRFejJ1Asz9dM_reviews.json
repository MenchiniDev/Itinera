We had adjoining rooms both with big balconies which we used early morning/late evening. There were many bars/restaurants a few minutes walk from the hotel and a lovely shopping mall where we had an amazing breakfast sitting outside next to the river/canal. The staff at the hotel were so helpful, especially Remi the supervisor, nothing was to much trouble for him. We would definitely stay here again!!",

            "text": "Got a nice and spacious room on the mezzanine Level of the 2nd floor. Huge and comfy bed with semi firm mattress and obviously good pillow/blanket/bed linen hygiene. Had a soothing sleep coming back from an event. Bathroom with tub and they also provide showergel/shampoo. A good hairdryer is offered as well. What I found nice that in addition to a working air conditon one can tilt the window to let in fresh air from the garden/courtyard side. Personnel was friendly and accommodating. There is room for improvement in the hallways and some area with detail cleanliness. The carpet looks pretty worn and could use a proper refurbish or at least a more frequent vaccuming imho. Would probably book again.",

Didn't feel like a 4-star hotel.It's quite far from the main  attractions.There are no 3 pin UK power points in the rooms.We went to ask reception how to charge our phones,they had a box full of adaptors(very convenient for the large number of UK visitors??),selling them for 15€ each!!The decor apart from the reception area is quite frankly-weird. The room service menu is very limited, especially if you're vegetarian.At any hotel we stay at breakfast is a must but here the prices are extortionate hence,we gave it a miss.Won't be visiting again.",
