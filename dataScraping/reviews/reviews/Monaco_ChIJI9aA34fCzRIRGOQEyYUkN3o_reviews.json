I would suggest asking them to bring your food out slowly as sometimes it can feel a bit rushed. The atmosphere is electric and perfect for a fun dinner. The DJ at the weekends is amazing and always brings a good vibe.",

I highly recommend the rock shrimp tempura and chicken salad, or honestly anything on the menu as everything I’ve had has been a pleasure. One of my favorite restaurants here in Monaco.",

I asked the waiter to make a sweet based cocktail with Rum and it tasted fantastic!! We waited an hour in the lounge before going upstairs for food. The food was a let down tbh, not worth the high price. Fried rice was hard, the Spring rolls is actually 2 cut in half and not 4 as advertised. I think you pay more for the vibe and location.",

Not only for dinner it's good but also for a quick snack outside on the terrace where it's perfect to have a drink also. Food is amazing and staff is polite and professional (expect the guy at the entrance downstairs can be a bit rude sometimes).",
