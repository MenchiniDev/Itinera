Ordered extra topping Parma ham for my Peperoni Pizza and got it uncooked raw on the side in a plastic box (see picture), what am I meant to do with that? Four Cheese pizza absolutely tasteless. If I was from Malta I'd have demanded a refund.\n\n1 star for giving me Parma ham to have with my breakfast sandwich the next day. What a joke.",
