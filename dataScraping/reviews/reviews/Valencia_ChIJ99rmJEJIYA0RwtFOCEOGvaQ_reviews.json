On our second visit we were treated with exceptional service from Cristina. Thank you to all the staff but most of all Cristina whose attention to detail was valuable.",

The staff kept the doors open and all the sand from the beach was on our plates, table, everywhere! We told them to shut the door but they shut the doors facing the alley on the side of the restaurant instead of the one towards the beach from where the sand was coming in. My daughter had to go close the door cause they just didn’t care. The floor was filthy with food remains which nobody bothered to clean. Service was very slow as well. My daughter dropped some food on the table by mistake and they kept serving the next course on the dirty table!",

Would not recommend unless you’re hungover at the hotel and can’t make it anywhere else. EDIT: El coso, do you think I’m lying?!?!!? How disrespectful. I shared an honest review and you completely disrespect and ignore what I said. Do better.",
