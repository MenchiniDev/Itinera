Clean, had everything we needed, and peaceful. The location of this hotel canâ€™t be beat! And they even arranged our early morning taxi to the airport! Love this place! Love the staff! Loved our room!!!!",

Hotel is well located, modern, rooms are very clean (I'm very picky about this!) and great water pressure in the shower!!!!! Front desk and breakfast staff are very professional, accommodating, and very helpful.  Breakfast was great! Alot of options to choose from and they even had lactose free milk!!!! I don't get that luxury when travelling and was pleasantly surprised and relieved to see that as an option!",

Good neighborhood, with lots of restaurants, grocery stores and anything else you may need. About a brisk 50 min walk to the beach. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable, the hotel clean, quiet and the breakfast had a lot of different options.",

            "text": "Amazing staff and service. Everyone at the hotel was always ready to help with anything from extra towels, water, or recommendations on the best restaurants. We always came back to a clean and tidy room with the tea and coffee reserves refreshed and the mini fridge stacked with water.\nBreakfast service was exceptional, very kind and attentive workers.\n\nThe location was amazing. Close to the metro and around 10 minutes from la Sagrada familia. A 20 minute metro ride to the beach or other popular tourist areas. Far enough away from Sagrada familia that the area is pretty quiet.\n\nCould not recommend this hotel more.",
