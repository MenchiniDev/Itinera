            "text": "Although this is a “boutique” hotel; there’s no coffee and tea facilities inside of rooms. Ao if you are a early morning coffee drinker; you must wake up, get out of your bed, wear your clothes and go down to the restaurant to be able to get a coffee! And no complimentary bottles of water. These items do not costs much more than 2-3 Euros! If you pretended to be a stylish boutique hotel, you should consider what your guests would expect…. Another thing is the tap water. It is placed on the wall; too much high and every time you wash hands or face, the water splashes out and your dresses are getting wet! Beside of that, lights buttons near the bed were not working, so it was very hard to wake up during the night to go and switch lights than to go to the bathroom……! The property must seriously consider these remarks….",

Being an American traveler I would rate this a 10 if I could! Very good food. We ordered the Tuna and it was beyond delicious. My husband had the teriyaki chicken it was excellent. We had the Cevapa (their version of sausage) excellent as well! You will not go wrong here. They are very kind to Americans! Next time we will most likely stay here.",
