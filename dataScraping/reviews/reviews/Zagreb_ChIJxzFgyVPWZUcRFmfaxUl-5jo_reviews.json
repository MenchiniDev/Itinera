The sound was overwhelmed by both treble and bass. They need to improve their climate control and sound quality. I left the event smelling like a sweaty ashtray.",

With two big problems: 1. they still use non-reusable plastic cups and produce tons of plastic each evening - such a shame for such a cool place. 2.ventilation has always been a problem, now a bit better, but still rather bad in the smaller part with smoking - just using normal AC instead of proper ventilation for a place of this calibre.",
