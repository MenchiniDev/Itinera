Before we got a table we had to order our food at the check in stand. We picked our table after we ordered. Sat outside. Food came out and it was plentiful and delicious! Had the risotto and the corn!! I would go back and try something else.",

The bar is very flexible in making cocktails you want, so you don't have to choose from menu only\nüí∂quite expensive place, surely not for a budget, but it's worth for the tastes and atmosphere\nüåüwould love to visit again",
