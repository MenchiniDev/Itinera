            "text": "Great hotel and I would stay here again! Not near center but I appreciated this. It was right near the main train station which was MUCH appreciated after a long journey! I wasn’t in the mood to navigate further, so this was a delight to simply walk there. So thoughtful to have tons of signage pointing you to the hotel! I even loved the area because there were great restaurants and shops near by with true locals. This gave me a great insight to life in Vienna! Loved the modern rooms and modern lobby. Check in girls very nice no matter the time. Great bartenders in the lobby. BEST thing was incredible breakfast and the little Biergarten! (Walk over to Bernardo’s for a delicious and cute dinner)",

It was 1:15 in the night , my train was delayed by four hours and despite being knocked over by other hotels as being booked out ( while they have rooms available on booking websites) , they really helped me out. Fabulous personal touch, the rooms are great and really recommend it to everyone.",

It’s also very close to the subway station. The room is very clean, and I found the bed and pillows to be quite comfortable. The price is also very reasonable.",

Overall, the quality is very good for the price I paid.",

I don't even know if the hotel has a housekeeping department since my room was filthy everywhere. The receptionists didn't seem to be professional and kind. They were sitting down and talking to each other all the time.  There's a lot to be improved.",
