For the price, the room was more than enough. Bathrooms were clean. The inside of the building itself is well decorated but nearly without any natural light which I didn’t like but I can’t complain..just outside the building you’re greeted with natural beauty and peaceful nature so it balances out. Great hospitality at the restaurant and great live music at the venue!",

EXTREMELY noisy, people coming in from the bar to use the hostel bathrooms CONSTANTLY. So the bathrooms are FILTHY, piss, hair and wet toilet paper everywhere and always occupied. They clean them daily but they are used by the bar patrons so you’ll be taking a shower with drunk lads banging on the door. It is not a small bar but a big terrace with 100+ people.\nRandom bar patrons wandering around at all hours, really weird vibe. The crowd of the bar isn’t really a young crowd either, like 30s, 40s but loud and messy.\nEverything is cheap, dirty, graffitied on, like living in an Erasmus bar. The rooms are TINY, nowhere to open a suitcase never mind unpack or put clothes. They didn’t give us any towels until the last day of our stay (??). If it were 30€ a night and you are a 20 year old student here to party with no need for sleep or pleasant shower experience it would be great! However its more expensive and it doesnt match what it advertises",
