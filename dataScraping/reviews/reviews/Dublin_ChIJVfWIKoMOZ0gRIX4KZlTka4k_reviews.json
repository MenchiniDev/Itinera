            "text": "We dined upstairs while live music played in the bar area downstairs. Two different musicians, both excellent, offered a mix of pop and traditional Irish music. The open plan space and decor made the dining space feel spacious and uncrowded (so many of the older pubs can feel a bit cramped & dark...which is great if you're looking for that vibe).  The service was excellent - friendly, fast, unobtrusive. The food was DELICIOUS!  The best stew I tasted during our 9-day stay. Prices were reasonable for the Temple Bar area.  Would definitely go back!",

            "text": "A nice walk from the Dublinia museum, which we were at prior to our starting our pub hopping day. The reason we entered was the Irish music.could be heard from outside. It was so good!!! There's was a man playing live music, both Irish and American styles. The beer was good and cold.  The service was friendly and quick. We sat at the bar, which was a good size. There are a lot of beer selections on tap. There was not a lot of table room, but they had a good vibe to the place. Would recommend.",

The place was full of tourists but they are definitely not getting the genuine Irish pub as there was zero chat and therefore no craic.\n\nWe eventually went upstairs to the restaurant to get some relief from the noise. It was still quite loud but at least we could have a conversation and the food was pretty good.\n\nI don't understand the need to play music at such a deafening pitch. It is a shame as this is a lovely place but we won't go back.",
