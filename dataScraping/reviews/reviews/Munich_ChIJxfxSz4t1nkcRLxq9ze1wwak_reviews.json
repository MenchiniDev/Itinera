However i guess many visit for the atmosphere and it’s definitely there. Live music gives a special charm. I highly recommend the Kaiserschmarrn dessert, it’s something else!",

I was very pleasantly surprised by how good the food and service was (thinking it would be just tourist fayre).\n\nWe enjoyed a mixed meat platter with bread, bread dumpling and sauerkraut which was plenty for 3 people while listening to traditional music and soaking in the atmosphere.\n\nThis is a must for everyone visiting Munich. You will not be disappointed.",

The food is average and the waiters don't seem to be very interested but it's a cool place with a nice atmosphere. If you know anything about history than you know that this is a must visit when in Munchen!",

Chatted with Swiss, French, Italians and Finn's. The waiter was Croatian. 1 large drink turned into 4.  Went for a quick drink and meal to have the experience and spent the evening.",
