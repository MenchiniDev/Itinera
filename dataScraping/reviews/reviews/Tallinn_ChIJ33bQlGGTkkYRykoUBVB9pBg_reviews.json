My favorite here is the rib-eye steak with mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes with blue mold cheese. The quality of meat is very high and consistent (have been around 10 times and never disappointed). Keep up the good work!",

A but on the pricy side and that‚Äôs because of location.\n\nI got the burger ‚Äî basic dish to test out any grill house! And this place did a good job. The beef was cooked to medium and remained juicy. Server was attentive and polite. If I go back, I will probably get a proper steak. You should too!",

            "text": "Been going to Helsinki Goodwin for years and the experience has been quite enjoyable, you get what you paid for, so for a date night we decided to try the Tallinn one instead of going for a steak to Argentina like we always did.\n\nAgree with many reviewers, service was sub-par. The only booking system, don't know if it works or not cuz I didn't receive any information after. Called the receptionist and they slammed the phone after getting reservation time, number of people and name. Didn't even bother with a thank you or a confirmation.\n\nWe went there anyways, table service took ages. Order 220g but received 300g steak instead. They didn't even ask which sauce we wanted. While paying, it was our first time in Europe that the waiter asked for tips, twice.\n\nKnowing that tipping culture isn't necessary in Estonia, though we still would've if it was a good service.\n\nThey'll live long due to location, but my search for the perfect steak restaurant in Tallinn continues =)",
