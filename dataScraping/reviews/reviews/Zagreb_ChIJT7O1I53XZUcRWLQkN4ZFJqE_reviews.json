The restaurant is closed, and they serve drinks only. The lady was kind, but it was a pain not to have dinner there.",

Our room was perfect and the breakfasts were excellent but what made our stay the best was the hospitality from the front desk personnel, especially Ivan.  So helpful.  So willing to assist you in anything you need.  The bus stop into the center of Zagreb was a one minute walk.  We really lucked out when we decided to stay at this hotel.",

It was a pleasure talking to them, all were very friendly young men, who did everything so we feel welcome and special guests. The restaurant itself is amazing, they cook incredibly good meals with a special touch of exquisite taste. Local beer a'd wine they recommended was also top. The room was perfectly clean, had a balcony and a bathtub, which was much appreciated after a long journey. Spacious parking, some of the lots were even covered. Possibility to pay with debit card if you don't happen to have local currency. Breakfast was fresh and tasty, we got scrambled eggs prepared for us, as well as genuine espresso and squeezed orange juice. The hotel is located in a quiet area and I highly recommend it to anyone who is travelling through Zagreb.",
