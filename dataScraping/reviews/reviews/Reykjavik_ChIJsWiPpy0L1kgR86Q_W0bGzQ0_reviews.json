            "text": "Beautiful Atmosphere with good, but not extraordinary, food. We had a pleasant experience, though it didn't quite live up to the high expectations. The atmosphere is delightful, with a warm and inviting decor that sets the stage for an exciting first impression. Service of the young gentlemen were very friendly and polite.\nWe ordered the tasting menu, anticipating something truly special given the restaurant's reputation as one of the best fish spots in the city. While the food was good, it didn't quite wow us. The starters, was a fried king prawn then a sushi platter, were reminiscent of an “all-you-can-eat” place back in Switzerland. I had hoped for more unique or creative fish preparations. That said, the black cod was definitely the highlight of the meal, showcasing the potential for excellence. Overall, it's a lovely place to enjoy a meal, but the food could use a bit more innovation to match the stunning ambiance. Dessert was also very nice presented and taste.",

            "text": "Upon our arrival in Reykjavik, our hotel concierge said that if we enjoy seafood then we had to try Fish Market! Was he ever right...The fish is extremely high quality and the sushi dishes are out of this world. Miso black Cod is like you've never had before and certainly try their potatoes fried in beer batter!!\n\nThe service was spectacular and the ambiance was amazing. Snorri, our waiter was extremely attentive and a pleasure to chat with. Must go and ask for Snorri!",
