            "text": "Service was awful, some of the worst I had. Waiter kept forgetting what we ordered and had to ask us over and over again. We got our starters 1h after ordering. Brought us the wrong bottle of water. Found out 1 hour after ordering they didn't have my main dish anymore, I reordered, then they got confused and got me a different main from the one I had to reorder which of course they said was for free. The problem is I couldn't it eat, so I had to reorder, at that point we were already sitting there for 1h30. Just had the time to eat the mains and got kicked out as the restautant was closing, no chance to get dessert. Worst experience. Too bad because food and scenery was great.",
