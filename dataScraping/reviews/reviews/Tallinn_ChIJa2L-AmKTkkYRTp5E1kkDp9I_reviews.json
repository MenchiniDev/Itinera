We had the most memorable evening getting served all tasty food and desserts coupled with quality wines. The Art deco style gives the place a unique atmosphere where you can imagine Edith Piaf singing beautifully while sipping your wine and watching the people walking by the large windows. Special thanks for the the restaurant owner for nice chat after our meal. We will come back!",

The service was very friendly but super efficient. Our waitress was attentive, but not overly so. As we were leaving we got into conversation with the son of the owner who kindly showed us around the lower ground floor and the internal courtyard as well has some of his screen prints which decorate the walls. Having only taken over the restaurant this year they are just building their reputation, but an establishment this good deserves to do very well indeed.",
