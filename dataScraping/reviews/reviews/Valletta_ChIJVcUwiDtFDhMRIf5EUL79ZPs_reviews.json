Spa, swimming was amazing, and views of the city with sunset were amazing.\nThe buffet was excellent for €28 euros and such a wide range of food.\nWe had a convention at the hotel, which was a great location and venue.\nI didn't stay at hotel so I can't review this.",

Other than that we loved our stay at this hotel. It was a short walk to a lot of sites, as well as the ferry to Valletta. We would definitely stay here again!",

The Temptasian restaurant was not quite the atmosphere described - food was good but they seated us at a table right near the kitchen without good ventilation and made it feel like a sauna then a restaurant.\n\nBreakfast was delicious and well worth while with great gluten free options.\n\nOverall, a great hotel and would definitely recommend.",

We stayed in the fragrance suite which was lovely and spacious although I think more hanging space would be good. I knocked one star off as it's starting to look a bit tired and could do with some tlc. The location was good but up a bit of an incline.",

Good service at all bars and friendly staff throughout. My only suggestion would be on the Saturday grill night. The photos promoting this event portray a grill with an amazing looking cut of meat. The reality is that it’s a buffet and all the meats are in heated chargers, coated in various marinades. I found the meats to be over flavoured and overcooked. At nearly €50 per head I didn’t consider this value for money.",
