Our room was big and nice; the only downside was that it was difficult to get cold enough water to drink from the tap. The personnel is very friendly and the breakfast is good. However, the biggest plus is the restaurant downstairs. The food is absolutely amazing and the personnel wonderful.",

Don't be put off by the exterior, inside is much nicer with elegantly furnished comunal areas and a bar with a small outside patio. We opted for Design rooms so got a higher floor. Rooms were a good size and the bed was comfortable. Noisy if you have a room overlooking the front of the hotel and sleep with the windows open.",

Room #403 needs to be redone as the washroom is so tight, even a cat can't fit in there. I was banging my elbows on the shower door behind me as I was brushing my teeth at the sink.",
