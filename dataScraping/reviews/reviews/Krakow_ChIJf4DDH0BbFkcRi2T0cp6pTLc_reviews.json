I also tried the stuffed onion and found it to be average. For dessert, the halva was delicious.\n\nThe staff speaks English and is friendly. The restaurant is beautiful.",

You have to pay additionally to listen to live music. The musicians were so bored that I had the feeling they are going to fall asleep. They were playing really bad. Absolute waste of money and time.",
