Presentation of the dishes is beautiful. A truly memorable experience. One gets to meet the young chef at the end which is a great bonus.",

The wine pairings were perfect and appropriate pours. We were not even buzzed after dinner.\nOur only complaint was the timing of the courses. About half way through the courses started slowing down. I'm not sure if this was intentional.\nThat's a minor grievance compared to the overall experience we had.\nThank you for such a memorable visit.",

The food is still great but I feel like it lacks more oomph. The deconstructed bouillabaisse feels like a miss to me and that’s also why. Service was impeccable, but the restaurant room felt too bright with view over Vieux Port and the basilica on the hill that could be more romantic with more dimmer lights.",
