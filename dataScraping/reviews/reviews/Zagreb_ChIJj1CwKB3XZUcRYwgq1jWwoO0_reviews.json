The location is not far from the church, it‚Äôs convenient.\n\nBut, it‚Äôs a bit over priced. A starter and main course costs 30 euro which was exactly the price I paid in a 5 start hotel.\n\nPlus, the meat is not fresh. I ordered ‚Äúgrandfather‚Äôs pan‚Äù, the chicken was dry, the beef was not fresh(I tasted it but didn‚Äôt eat), the pork was good.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant.",

As starters we shared deep fried donuts with cheese and strukli. We started with a bottle of Croatian beer. Everything including drinks, starters & main dishes were very satisfying. Generous portion accompanied by bread. The staff was very helpful and candid. Combination of nice stroll and this setting made it a nicely spent evening. Good job and thanks to the full team giving a good experience to the guests..",
