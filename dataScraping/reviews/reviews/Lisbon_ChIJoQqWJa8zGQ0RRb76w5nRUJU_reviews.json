At your arrival just give your name and number of people.\nWe stayed outside with only 1 staff member for all the tablets, he was literally running between tables and at the same time trying to be friendly and attentive.\nThe food was tasty.\nRecommended.",

I recommend you let the waiter know whether to charge your own country currency or Euro, in our case there is a premium charge our own local currency.\n\nHope you find this review helpful",

Looks nothing special from the outside nor from its location - but the fact it is packed out every evening with locals prepared to wait for a table tells all you need to know.\nGreat selection of Meat and Fish dishes and everything we had was of the highest quality, well prepared and truly delicious. Desserts we're excellent too.\nService was very friendly and remarkably fast for a large Restaurant filled to capacity.\nI wish I was not a tourist and this restaurant was near enough for me to come back again and again.\nTruly excellent and thanks to all the staff that made it possible",
