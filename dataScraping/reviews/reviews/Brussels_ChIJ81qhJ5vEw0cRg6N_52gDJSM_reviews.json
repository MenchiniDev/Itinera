I travel a lot, but I have never seen such breakfast, just magnificent. The rooms are clean. After repair, the staff is very amiable. Highly recommend!",

Sit on the pot, no door, in the shower look at the rest of the room!\nThe breakfast is fine, did not eat in the restaurant. For the money and what I know now, I would go further out and use the public transport to commute or walk!\nNice enough place.\nCertainly not worth €220 a night!",

I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. Good range of breakfast and hassle free service. They also keep your luggage after the check out which a bonus. More vegetarian options in breakfast would have made me more happy. But over all with three nights stay I am very satisfied with the service I received. If I will be in Brussels next time I will not think twice to book this hotel. Please give me good rates. :) All the staff were super friendly and helpful. Thank you for your hospitality.",
