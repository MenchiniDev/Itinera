The broth is rich with the flavors of tomatoes, fennel and saffron, and the fish is impeccably fresh as you can see in the picture. Handmade aioli and rouille are to die for! The staff are welcoming, friendly, and helpful. The price is reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients, and a bargain compared to other nearby restaurants serving true bouillabaisse.",

I wanted to eat it again, so I visited in 2021 from Japan. But the experience was terrible. The bouillabaisse surved very ordinary and the fish soup tasted much worse. I wonder if the chef or the owner has changed. I want to eat that delicious fish soup that you can't get anywhere else again, but I don't have the courage to visit again after being disappointed the second time.",
