            "text": "Went here for dinner while staying nearby, it was recommended by the person who owns the place I'm staying. It was lovely food, I had the chicken and vegetables in a clay pot and it was really flavourful. It came with some nice bread and I ordered a glass of red wine. Altogether I paid with a 10 Euro note and that included a tip. They brought out a cognac and mousse for dessert, which was a lovely and unexpected bonus! It isn't something I'd normally drink but the congnac paired really well with the mousse, which was an unexpected bonus. I'd definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a restaurant. The place is now smoke free and has a lovely atmosphere.",

The food was terrible, meat too fatty, shopshka salad tasteless, the burger not too good.\nAbove all, the service was mediocre.\nDon’t understand on what criteria people base their reviews…..",
