The staff is very helpful and nice, the location of the hotel is perfect. Close to shopping streets with cafes and restaurants. The only small downside is that the beds are a bit hard, but the rooms are really worth the price. We really enjoyed our stay here, I would recommend this hotel to everyone. :)",

There is a small elevator, but you need to shout to the employees, so that they can come out with the key. Nobody responses to the ringing button.\n\nI loved everything about this hotel. Location, price, bed, great pillow menu!\n\nPlease take my 4 stars as my good will to improve the one and only disadvantage of this hotel.",

There's a bar downstairs but no restaurant (except for breakfast). Restaurants in easy walking distance. Staff here were helpful and small issues were fixed in a reasonable amount of time. It was quiet at night.\nThe rooms could have done with usb chargers as well as sockets, we were very surprised to find none. The pillows are unbelievably uncomfortable. They do offer a pillow menu, but there was only one other kind available which also offered none of its promised support. Every time we arrived or left through the front door there was a group of people smoking on the top step and no effort was apparently made to encourage them to smoke elsewhere.",
