The lady put the chicken and the cheese and it was ready to go into the grill. The other staff member looked at it, rummaged with his hands and took chicken pieces out from the sandwich and tossed them back into food counter and told the lady \"too much chicken.\" Kinda gross? It would be fine if that's what they put to begin with. But to make the sandwich, decide I was getting too much chicken, take it out, and put it back into the fresh food. WEIRD!!!!!!!!!",
