            "text": "I stayed in the camping for three nights and ate here all three days. Food was good, they show football inside or you can sit outside. My second day I was very happy with the service and chats I got from two older gentlemens, they gave such a good vibe and gave me cake and some alcohol on the house after my meal. Sweet guys and good laugh. My last day I didnt have so luck with the service, a girl in glasses need to check her attitude as she was annoyed from the moment I asked for a table for 1, had to wait 20 min and no one took my order, and had to disturb her running around and ask to order and she answered snarky. This attitude continued when I was going to pay as well. I understand you are busy, But please take a little better care of your guests, especially solo travelers! Thank you for this time, see you again ☺️",

Of course the manager did not accomodate us and ended up traveling all the way back to San Marino. However, the design and overall arrangement of the outdoor seating looks very nice and perhaps this would have been a nice experience.",
