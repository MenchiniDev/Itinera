The heaters are not working at all and they could not even find any other heater and even the hair dryer is not warm at all! I asked them to change and this 5 stars\nhotel even could not find a new one. Their reply was ‘you know the hotel is very old and the heating system is not working properly’. I do not know of course! You have to say this while you are asking that much money for the standards of 5 star hotel. Totally disappointed…",

The rooms were spotless and sufficiently equipped for any guest. The self service shop came in handh more than once. The hotel bar, manned by Fatima of whom was one of the kindest individual we have met in amsterdam, highest of praise! Janke, was also very chatty and lovely! Overall, excellent service and a very accommodating hotel",

Despite telling the cleaning staff I didn’t need room service, they entered my room anyway, cleaned the bathroom, and mistakenly took my personal towel (which was the same color as the hotel’s). To make matters worse, the next morning, staff tapped and opened my door around 9am and 10am without knocking, disturbing my sleep. I feel uncomfortable with anyone entering my room without permission. I reported these issues to the concierge that night, and they promised to follow up the next morning—but I had to ask again, and they were still “looking” for my towel as I was checking out. This experience was truly disappointing",

However, staffs are overall not friendly and there was no fitness centre or gym. Daily room cleaning was taken care of but vacuuming was not clean enough with fallen hairs.",
