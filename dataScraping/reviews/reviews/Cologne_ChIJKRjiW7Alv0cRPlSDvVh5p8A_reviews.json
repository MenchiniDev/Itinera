Large portions and good flavor.  All was well prepared considering the rumors of bland cuisine of the area.  A matter of fact staff just this side of almost rude.  Good time had by all.  Nice find.  üëè",

Shortly understaffed.\nUnfortunately when it comes to paying the bill, the waitress told us directly we have to leave a tip even tho service is non existent. We ended paying 13% more on top of the bill for tips as she loudly tapped the card machine on the table. Unpleasant meal experience.",

I had the schnitzel dish, and we also tried the sausage and the turkey dishes, and all of them were delicious üòã. Local beer local food and German feeling we had a great time. Definitely recommend and would come back again.",

Overall, there are definitely better places to dine in Cologne.",
