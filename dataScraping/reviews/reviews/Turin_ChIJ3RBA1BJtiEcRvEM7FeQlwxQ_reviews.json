Only an extra fold-up bed was added to one room and one ended up being for 4 and the hotel had to give and extra room to the group.\nThe buffet was not good and when asked for a soy milk cappuccino and told it could be done the manager used cow milk anyhow.\nAt the end of the stay we had requested to leave luggage at the hotel and were asked to pay an extra 3â‚¬ per person simply for it to be left in the main kitchen area unsupervised.\nWould not recommend especially to a larger group of people but seeing the service I would not recommend in general.",

Shower was lovely but could do with a shelf or something to put your toiletries on. Young guy really helpful and carried my enormous suitcase right to the room for me. Only downside, it would be better if you were told beforehand that you must pay for the water bottles they put in your room especially as you cannot drink the tap water. Great for a quick stop over.",
