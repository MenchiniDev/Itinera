There are several dishes we order every time or frequently, and Ebi Tempura (king prawn) is definitely the top one. Their Unadon (eel) is the best among all the others in Helsinki that are offering the dish.",

The sushi and sashimi is good, I can't tell how the fish are different from other restaurants but the sushi rice and rice in general here is really good, just the right balance between stickiness and dryness. The highlight of the set is the appetizer, salmon in soy sauce, and the dessert, matcha ice cream with red bean paste.\nOne minus point is that they forgot my tea, which is included in the set. I was full anyway so I didn't ask, but this is one thing the service needs improvement.",
