The TV comes with a Google cast, ours had a technical issue so the staff upgraded us to a superior room. ❤️\nThe food in the room service was disappointing however, but there are a lot of very good food options at walking distance.",

The hotel is lovely with fair size rooms, great breakfast, a nice lounge/restaurant and a small roof top pool to cool off in. Staff were simply excellent! They responded quickly to inquiries before arriving and were very helpful while there. Very clean and only about a 35 minute metro ride to city centre. Also lots of shopping and restaurants close to hotel. Definitely recommend!",

And today at checkout again she was most helpful to us qith our luggage and our comfort\nThe other staff that we met were all very polite and helpful also, but I have got to say that Wendy sets a very high standard for them to follow.\n\nThank you.",

Easy access to the University campus, Camp Nou and the Metro (giving access to all of Barca).  The room was well set up with a surprisingly spacious shower. While a bit chilly, the pool was a great place to wind down on a hot afternoon!\nBreakfast was amazing and a perfect start to each day!",
