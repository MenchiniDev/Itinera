The hotel was in terrible condition and dirty!\n\nAt night, the cold in the rooms was unbearable, even though the Air Condition was on, as the windows were broken and wouldn't close. As for the view from the room, it was uninteresting and disappointing!\n\n‚ùóThe hotel does not even meet basic expectations, and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and clean place to stay‚ùó\n\n4 ‚≠êü§îü§î WHY ????",
