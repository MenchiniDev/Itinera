We only ordered 4 dishes, but were sat in the restaurant for 2 hours and asked to get the bill / pay our bill 3 times\n\nThe portions are quite small and the prices are a tad higher than other small plates restaurants in lisbon but I will say the quality of the ingredients is high; the flavours were delicious, a standout was the cabbage with blue cheese. 4 stars for the food",

            "text": "This was a true five star experience as the food, service, and atmosphere were all exceptional. This is not a fancy spot but has pronominal food and service. It was evident it was a popular spot as every seat was filled by 8pm.\nFrom the moment we walked in the door our waitress helped us understand the ever-changing menu. The dishes came out in a timely fashion and each was delicious. The Somalia brought our dining to the next level by letting us try our wine pick before bringing us the bottle and made sure we had wine and food to enjoy throughout the night. This was the most European dining experience I‚Äôve had as we were not rushed to finish our dinner, wine, and dessert. I highly recommend this restaurant as a must-try when in Lisbon!",

Tapas portions here are much bigger than back home, which was a nice surprise. We started with the sardinhas em brioche (sardines on brioche) and the ravioli de bochecha (pork cheek ravioli), both packed with flavor. For tapas, we tried the couve cora√ß√£o (heart cabbage with Stilton cheese), pani puri with Azorean tuna tartare (tuna tartare with truffled egg yolk), and the burrata with beet and smoked almonds. Perfect amount for two. Highly recommend checking it out!",
