            "text": "This hotel is one block away from the Metro. Along the way, there are multiple bars and markets. Great location. Additionally, the hotel rooms are clean. I can't stress that enough. The gym in this hotel is better equipped than some regular gyms. The cleaning staff is working constantly. If the management reads this review, please give your cleaning staff a compliment. I saw several of them working meticulously and they were quick to say hello with a smile.\n\nLast, but not least, the staff at reception and the bar are respectful, quick, cheerful and super helpful.\n\nWe are very grateful to have found this hotel.",

The breakfast buffet is fantastic with just about anything available.  What more could you want?  Definitely worth a stay here.  I will definitely look for this brand when traveling in Europe in the future!",

My first room was bad smelling from the bathroom and the shower was dipping water frequently.\nEven if in the Bar area there is two special menu for bar snacks. One from 12:00 to 22:30 and another upto 24:00, I tried to order some tortilla chips now at 22:20, but the answer was the kitchen is closed at this time.\n\nedit:\nLater there was an offer for some cheese plate.\nBreakfeast is decent.\n\nBut as I am still in the hotel, I have not got any upgrade offered to Junior Suite so far as owner said in his reply.",
