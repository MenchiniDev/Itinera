As well as tasty pasta 4 cheese highly recommended. The risotto is perfect for the spicy food lovers between us. The service on a high level. In the end we were treated with Lemoncello and jägermeister with dessert.",

First of all the food it is not anything special, the portions are extremely small and the taste is disappointing for the price you pay. The quality of the food is equal to places that are much, much cheaper than Uranija. Staff is mostly frowned and not friendly at all.",
