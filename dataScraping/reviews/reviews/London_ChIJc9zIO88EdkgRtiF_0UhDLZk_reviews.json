We stayed four nights and nothing was too much trouble. Friendly greetings and chats with the door staff from the very first moment we arrived. An extra special mention and big thank you to Pervez who was exceptional with how he helped us everyday with happy banter about the weather, local attractions and much more. He also went above and beyond as we were checking out to organize a car to the airport at very short notice.  Thank you !",

The building architecture is absolutely stunning, and the grounds out front are absolutely beautiful! The location is perfect right across the street from the Thames, and an underground station right around the corner. Everything is so accessible, I loved it here so much! Anytime I come back to London I will definitely be staying here and recommending this hotel to everyone I know!",

The service was outstanding, and our wine glasses were refilled before they ran empty. Because it was both my sister's and my birthdays, we were greeted with the cutest birthday slice and a greeting from the staff. 5 stars for service and food all around; can't wait for the next visit.",

Breakfast was very good. I would have liked the toasts be organised in a different way as we did not like standing and waiting in a queue as if in a gas station! The staff was very nice and helpful in many ways.",
