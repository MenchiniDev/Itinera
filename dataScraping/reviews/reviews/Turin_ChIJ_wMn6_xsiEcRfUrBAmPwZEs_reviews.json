We also had the house red wine, a beautiful Dolcetto - so delicious. Our server was very patient with our poor Spanish and tried to converse in English with us. We even got a Lemoncello on the house to finish off. Fantastic and attentive service in a lovely atmosphere away from the road. Would recommend if you're in the area.",
