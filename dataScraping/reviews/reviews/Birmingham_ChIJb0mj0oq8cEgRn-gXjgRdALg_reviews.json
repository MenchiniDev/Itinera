            "text": "Absolutely excellent spa experience and treatments (had it for the second time, loved it both times). Would definitely recommend booking it on a week day as facilities are small.\n\nDelicious food\n\nRestaurant staff overly eager at times when it was not needed and dismissive when we actually needed support. Watched us struggle through the room full of busy tables with our pushchair and belongings instead of helping us to an easier route at the back (like they did at the end).\nNo knowledge of the menu\nWe requested some more bread to finish butter and were brought more butter which has defeated the object\nWe were asked about 3 times how each course was but nothing about the occasion, which would have been nice considering it was my birthday\n\nWe will be back to the spa but not restaurant",

We found the festive tea not our taste NOT Malmaison's fault. Just our expectation. We settled for the cream tea. The Christmas tree cake was a lovely treat to the eye and the taste. Scone was quite dry and non descript. Dry , cream helped but very small. Ambience and service was impeccable. Will check menu before going again",

Thank you",
