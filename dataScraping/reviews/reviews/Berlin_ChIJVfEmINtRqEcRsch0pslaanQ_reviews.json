            "text": "Classic Austrian cuisine. This biased reviewer thinks it's inevitably all better in Vienna, but it's still tasty / satisfying at this Berlin institution not far from Checkpoint Charlie and Unter den Linden.\n\nSo busy / packed on a Thursday evening we had people knocking things on our table as they squeezed past getting to/from theirs. I also thought the Kartoffelsalat serving with the Schnitzel was a little stingy for the price-point - not to mention asking for tap water and getting a ‚Ç¨9.50 bottle of still mineral water!",

            "text": "Great traditional food, very good service and an authentic atmosphere. The only hair in the soup for me is that the establishment allows people to bring their dogs. While we were there a couple of them started to bark aggressively at each other.\n\nRecommended!\n\nPS: We came back a few days later to lunch again, because we liked the food, the service and the authenticity of the place so much. The second time we did not have a reservation, and the place was packed. But we were greeted very kindly and quickly given a table. Everything was as good as the first time around or even better as there were no dogs the second time.",
