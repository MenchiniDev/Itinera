Location is not far from the center, but in a safer-feeling neighborhood. Crazy cheap, but you still get a nice stay. Friendly staff. The shower changed temperature about ten times though, but other than that it was nice",

They advertise parking but it has maybe 5 parking spots in a lot that should only be able to fit 2. It is near good food and some nightlife so you may be woken up in the middle of the night to the sound of drinkers retching in the street. The front desk was rarely open for help. Avoid unless you seriously need to save money on your stay. Even then, there are probably better spots.",
