The anchovy in herb oil was a particular favourite and the honey ribs are definitely not to be missed.",

Inside can get very crowded, but was well worth the trip.  Really enjoyed the food and wine, but it had a very special ambiance which inspired a 3 hour meal.  High recommend.",

Their \"cigar\" is a must-try, but honestly, go ahead and order the whole menu because everything is delicious! Special mention to the service team who are absolutely lovely as well.",
