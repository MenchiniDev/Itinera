It is possible to get new towels during your stay. Good international breakfast. With hot and cold parts, fruit and a sweet part.",

Their breakfast buffet is the best. Their staff is PHENOMENAL! Martin at the door is always pleasant and funny. There is no question about dining, directions, or history he can't answer. The front desk staff is stellar! Diana was there almost every day we were, this trip. She was incredibly gracious and delightful to talk with. Since my first stay in 2015 I have recommended  the Temple Bar Inn to everyone who has asked where they should stay in Dublin. This is my personal go-to hotel. I LOVE IT! Thank you Temple Bar Inn!",
