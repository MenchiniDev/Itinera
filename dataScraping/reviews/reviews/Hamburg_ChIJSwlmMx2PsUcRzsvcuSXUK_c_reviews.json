            "text": "Great restaurant, though could be difficult to see where you go in from the door. Its got really great character and was conveniently 100m from our hotel (Premier Inn). The food choice was traditional German, exactly what we wanted and you could either choose from the buffet where you were served from displayed meats and vegetable options or from a set menu selection. The beer was great and the ambience was fantastic, dimly lit with candles but kind of magical. The service was excellent and catered for English, though predominantly a german restuarant. From couples to large groups they catered for all in a traditional setting. Would go again!!",
