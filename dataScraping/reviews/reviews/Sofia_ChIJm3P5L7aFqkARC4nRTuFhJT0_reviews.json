Breakfast buffet with few varieties, dirty eating areas, everything cold. Average room. Really unpleasant staff. I had booked for 5 days, but I left on the second day, since staying in that place is really impossible. Not recommended at all.",

            "text": "I recently visited this hotel without a reservation, hoping to find a room. After being informed by the receptionist that they were fully booked, I returned to my car, only to find I‚Äôd been charged a 3 leva parking fee for just a few minutes. When I went back to the reception for clarification, I encountered some of the most unprofessional and dismissive behavior I‚Äôve ever experienced.\n\nThe receptionist insisted on payment in leva, despite my explaining that I had just arrived and hadn‚Äôt had a chance to exchange currency yet. When I asked if there was an alternative option, she responded with rude comments like, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here if you don‚Äôt have leva?‚Äù and even, ‚ÄúAre you from the moon?‚Äù Eventually, she offered to accept euros‚Äîbut only at an absurdly high exchange rate, which made it clear she had no intention of being helpful. Frustrated, I decided to walk away, feeling that this was a type of trouble I didn‚Äôt need.\n\nOnly after this difficult interaction did a helpful parking attendant inform me that there was an ATM across the lobby‚Äîinformation the receptionist had conveniently neglected to mention.\n\nHonestly, I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. It didn‚Äôt affect my day, but I could see how this kind of treatment could ruin the experience for other guests who simply want a smooth, welcoming check-in. I hope hotel management takes note and retrains their front desk staff to handle guest interactions more professionally. I ended up booking at another hotel in Sofia, where I received far better service. Until this hotel addresses its reception staff‚Äôs behavior, I‚Äôd recommend future guests consider other options.",

The lobby bar was 5 meters away from us, with people enjoying some drinks. Ridiculous and obvious lie.\n\nWe are happy we did not book a room here.",
