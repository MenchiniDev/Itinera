Thanks for the receptionnists kindness. 8 min from the train station and a view of the cathedral ! (although the bell rings for 5 min at 7am, be warned aha)",

Nothing wrong with the rooms but they were very basic: clean, comfortable and safe. Walk out the front door and the cathedral and high-streets are right there. Would stay again for the convenient location and price.",

Very reasonably priced, good simple breakfast offering enough choices, again at a very reasonable cost.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Looking forward to coming back on one of my future business trips.",

The quality of the rooms is probably fine for a solo traveller without high expectations. For anyone with a family the noise from the shopping plaza continued until the church bells started going off at 6am and in the summer it was too hot to close the windows.",
