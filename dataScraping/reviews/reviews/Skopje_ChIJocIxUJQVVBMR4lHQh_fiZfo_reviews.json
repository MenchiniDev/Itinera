Additional things that you don't find in you room can be asked and provided by the reception, like the hair drier. They also have a good choice of conference rooms in case you need to stay for business.",

They offer parking free of charge with a 24/7 monitoring service for a worry free peace of mind.\nAll of the staff was fluent in English with a very professional, yet friendly attitude.\nThe choice of freshly prepared food offered for breakfast, lunch and dinner was simply delicious in a price range much lower than  high end restaurants in the city. There was no need to wander around looking for a place to eat.\nIt's pretty close to the city downtown, and if you don't mind the 10-12min walk, you'll avoid the struggle to find parking downtown.",
