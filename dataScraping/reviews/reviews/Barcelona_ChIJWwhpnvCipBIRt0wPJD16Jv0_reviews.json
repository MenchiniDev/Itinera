            "text": "I was stunned upon entering the Hotel. Wife had booked it and didn’t realize it was a 5 Star establishment as we have been just traveling through Europe. We were greeted promptly by Zak! An amazing person that was so friendly and took care of us so well! He got us a couple of glasses of champagne and chocolates. Helped with our luggage to our room and showed is a few things. They even upgraded our room to an art style. The shower was sooo cool! The hospitality was amazing. The rooftop bar and pool were sweet! WE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE! We saw Zak again the next day and he was just so wonderful to talk with. I hope the Hotel sees this review and gives Zak the highest praise! He is an amazing member of the team that should absolutely be recognized!",

The bar/restaurant served a beautiful breakfast and afternoon cocktails were spectacular. The rooftop bar provided the perfect backdrop to relax after a long day and the spa facilities were first rate.\nThank you Ohla for making our first trip to Barcelona unforgettable.",

The service was impeccable, the rooms were beautifully designed, and the rooftop pool felt like a dream come true. The views of Barcelona from the rooftop terrace were simply breathtaking, and we were always able to find available loungers, as it never felt too crowded. We were also pleasantly surprised by the early check-in, and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable, offering friendly and attentive service throughout.",
