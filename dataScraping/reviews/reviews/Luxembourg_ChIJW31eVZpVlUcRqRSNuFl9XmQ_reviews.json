            "text": "Highly recommended!! This is a beautiful camping with lots of shady spots to accommodate a large 7.5 metres camper.  We were able to choose our own spot.  From some of the lower camping spots there are amazing views of neighbouring farms and lovely Haflinger ponies in the green hills. Monumental willow trees and other deciduous and coniferous trees provide shade and a really scenic atmosphere of nature, with birds and squirrels nearby. The showers were very clean with good drainage and hot water,  there are many showers to choose from and also toilets are nice and clean and always with toilet paper.\nThe one thing that was a bit difficult was emptying the grey water tank near the entrance / exit, it can be a tight spot but with a talented driver it was fine!\nThe outdoor terrace at the bistro restaurant had a very friendly feeling, the wait staff very kind and thoughtful to us and toward our dog ðŸ¥° The food is fresh and the service relatively quick, we didn't wait long for drinks.\n.\nThank you so much Camping Ettelbruck for a great stop on our road trip and we might see you again someday ðŸ˜Š",
