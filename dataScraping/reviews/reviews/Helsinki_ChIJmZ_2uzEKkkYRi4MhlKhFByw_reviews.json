            "text": "The food was delicious, good customer service. I dined here specifically for the red currant dessert. Unfortunately it arrived half melted unlike the pictures I’d seen on Google reviews so I was a bit disappointed especially because I planned to post a picture in my own review. The server just said that the dessert melts quickly since it’s taken out to thaw and only after I mentioned I’d seen pictures where it was not melted did she offer another one with a wait which I wasn’t interested in. Overall a good restaurant that I would go back to.",

The restaurant employees were very nice, continously attending to our every need. The atmosphere was cozy and professional, perfect for catching up with family. And the food was delicious, both my guests and me were surprised! I ordered first pumpkin soup (13€) as a starter and then the cabbage roll (24€). Both were very nice and filling, and I think I could have just had the roll and I would have been fine. The roll was particularly astounding; I hadn't had such a delicious vegetarian dish ever! Thank you for this evening, and I will sure look forward to coming again.",
