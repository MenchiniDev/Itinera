Rooms and hotel is a little aged but okay. AC on level seven had to work hard against sun from rooftop and windows but great views!",

Staff could improve on English, breakfast was repetitive, I would suggest a replacement of the lift as it was very hot and takes about a minute before the doors opened.",

The breakfast was better than the excelsior which we had just moved from and was a lot more expensive & you can have your breakfast outside around the pool looking over Spinola bay. Definitely recommend",

You have to be early to the pool to get a spot if you’re a friend group or a family. The air conditioning is central system, that means you don’t get it under 20°c inside your room. The gym is small, but if you are creative, you can get an ok workout.\nOverall a good experience.",

Pool area was dirty, food squashed into sun beds, breakfast - a good buffet breakfast but don’t ask for anything. It could do with some sound-isolation panels on the ceilings as it’s loud and echoes. Still a long way from a 4-star hotel. The location is great and the potential is there. Room cleaning staff were lovely. Reception/check in lacked a ‘welcome’ vibe. Maybe that’s how it is in Malta? I don’t think so though as everywhere else, service was warm and helpful.",
