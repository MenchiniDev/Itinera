            "text": "The food was good. I specifically enjoyed the deep fried plantain starters. What ruined the dining experience was the table they seated us at and the service. The table to the left of the entrance in the corner should not exist for quests. Waiters and guests are constantly bumping into your chair and each time the door opens, a cold draft is hitting you. We had a reservation that started at 20:00 and our order was taken at 20:30. We got our starter at 21:00. With the unfortunate sitting place we had a constant view of the waiters behind the counter and could hear them talk, and frankly there was no reason for this level of slow service as they were not busy most of the time.",
