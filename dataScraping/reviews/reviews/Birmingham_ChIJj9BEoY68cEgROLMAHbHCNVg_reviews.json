And we were quickly seated at our table - drinks service was quick. The Menu offered a good selection. Again Service was good and polite.  Food arrived quickly, hot and well presented. By the time we left it was very busy.  Would definitely recommend",

What truly sets a place apart is the combination of perfect cuisine, outstanding customer service, and a kind soul at the helm. Gea, the manager at San Carlo, embodies all of these qualities. Her dedication to ensuring a flawless dining experience, coupled with her warm and welcoming nature, makes every visit to San Carlo a delight. Itâ€™s this rare blend of excellence that turns a good restaurant into an extraordinary one. Thank you, Gea, for making every meal memorable.",

            "text": "So I'm giving San Carlo a 3 out of 5 rating, which I feel is very reasonable.\nLet's start with the positive!  The food was actually DELICIOUS!!!!  The steak and oysters were to die for!\nThe reason I'm only giving 3 stars is for the service.  Now, let me say that the staff were very apologetic but it still ruined the experience slightly.\nOur reservation was for 7.30pm, we arrived on time as we were already in the area.  The table wasn't ready so we were asked to wait at the bar.  At 8.05pm we were still waiting for our table.  At around 8.15pm we were seated and our order was taken.  At 8.45pm we still hadn't even had any drinks.  I know this seems a little harsh, but 3 out of my 4 plates were cold/raw and didn't even require cooking.\nThere was no option to remove the service which I didn't feel was deserved.\nWas the food worth it, ABSOLUTELY!\nWould I eat there again?.....Probably not ðŸ˜¢",

Definitely do not recommend the seafood ravioli, it tasted like tinned spaghetti. Service was okay. Atmosphere was unfortunately poor, very loud due to tables being packed together and did not feel very luxurious.",
