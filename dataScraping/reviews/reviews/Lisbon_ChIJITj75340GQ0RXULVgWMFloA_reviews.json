            "text": "March 9th 2024, dinner at Belcanto (in Lisbon):\nMy first time at a 2-star Michelin restaurant üçΩÔ∏è I couldn‚Äôt pass up the opportunity and thankfully 4 of my colleagues were up for the adventurous eating too!\nOne thing we didn‚Äôt think about beforehand was that we would all have to choose the same menu üòê This was a bit of a challenge, but we agreed on the Classic Tasting Menu.\n\nThese places always come up with fun presentations of the food and mix the flavors in a surprisingly delightful way‚Ä¶. Usually. They even had a choreographed way of pouring two people‚Äôs water at a time and delivering all 5 dishes on to the table by 5 servers, at the exact same time.\n\nWhile this place was everything I‚Äôd expect; both my colleague and I struggled with the gold leaf covered poached egg dish (The Garden of the Goose that Laid the Golden Egg) ü§¢ Both of us ended up gagging due to texture and had to put the dish aside. She only got 1 bite in, I got about 4‚Ä¶ I so badly wanted to enjoy all of the truffle in the dish, but the texture of that slimy egg ü•ö was just not working for me üòÇ They offered to bring her another dish in place of the egg since she barely touched it, which was nice of them.\n\nWe added the Scarlet prawns to our menu selection for ‚Ç¨100 for each order, but thankfully you can order as half a serving for ‚Ç¨50. And since you‚Äôre already eating quite a bit of food, I‚Äôd say the half order was the perfect amount.\n\nI‚Äôll never regret trying something new, but I also don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out if I don‚Äôt go again. It‚Äôs just expensive for food that is pushing my food boundaries and I‚Äôm not enjoying all of the textures.\n\nOh and for dessert, they give you a sleeve of a button up shirt in place of a napkin so you can wipe your mouth on the white sleeve, clever üòâ",

The food was good, well-prepared, and flavorful, though it didn't stand out as exceptional.\n\nWhat affected the experience, however, was the service towards the end of the meal. When my group asked to split the bill by item, it was met with noticeable impatience, and the overall interaction felt rushed and impersonal.\n\nUnfortunately, this took away from what could have been a more enjoyable dining experience.\n\nFor a restaurant of this caliber, I expected more attentiveness and professionalism in service.",
