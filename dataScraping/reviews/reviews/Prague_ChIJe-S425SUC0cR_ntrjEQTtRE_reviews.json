Lovely staff, fantastic breakfasts every morning and the rooms are awesome. The front of house, back of house and hospitality staff are very well organised, make those staying here their priority and do it in an almost effortless way. Excellent location in Prague too.\n\nWe have stayed in a fair few 5 Star Hotels in our collective time but I don‚Äôt think we have ever enjoyed a stay quite like this.",

            "text": "Our experience at the Grand Mark was second to none on our trip in Europe. From the moment we pulled up in the taxi the service was out of this world, friendly, & went the extra mile to make our time there special. Front desk, concierge, cleaning staff, spa service, and food services staff were engaging, friendly, and always greeted you with a smile. We spend five nights there & everyday was great there. It‚Äôs location makes all of Prague accessible & there recommendations from the staff with have you at the best locations & get a local feel, not just the tourist places. Cannot say enough good things about our time at the GM. Would stay again, no questions asked. Well worth the cost.",
