I recommend this place.\n\nA little update here, today we went there with a friend, and we ordered pizza and an ice cream cocktail, apparently, the lady who was accepting the order brought us a strawberry cocktail\nInstead of chocolate. She approached us after several minutes and served chocolate one for free due to a mistake. I mean it means a lot to customers, this is the service that most Estonian restaurants are missing.\n\nThanks for being kind and caring to ward customers.",

Overall I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a place to have a quick meal while visiting Tallinn and you happen to be around it. It's also fairly close to the Old Town, which makes it an ideal spot to go to in between visits.",
