Good selection of spirits too. Prices are acceptable for city center and the quality provided. No parking around so try to get here by taxi or public transport. Make sure you book the table in advance as the place is very popular.",

We had lamb loin, Lagsana, Aged beef and Pork loin, cauliflower soup and pumpkin soup. Everything cooked to our liking and perfection. Though the assorted bread is not the main but we love the bread too. Waiters are courteous and professional. I think they deserve the highest rating amongst all the restaurants that we have visited in this trip. Price is reasonable. We will be definitely be back again.",

The pasta was perfectly cooked, and the octopus was tender and flavorful, making for a dish that was both delicious and memorable. The combination of flavors really hit the mark, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is quite classy, with a refined atmosphere that adds to the overall dining experience.
