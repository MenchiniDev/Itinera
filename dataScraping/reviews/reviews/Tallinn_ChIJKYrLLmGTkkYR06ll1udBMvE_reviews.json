Otherwise basic room with all you need.\n\nBought breakfast at the hotel once, it was 5 minutes before buffet closed, which I didnt know or check. Staff did not point this out to me which is poor service as I barely managed to get one plate of food.\n\nLocation is however prime, short distance to the old city. And the hotel has it's own spa with different saunas and hot pools.\n\nAll in all could return.",

There were four saunas, they were okay. Slight minus not to be able to have drink in the pool, but some people still did it, even signs everywhere. Room was a not new anymore and it didn't smell fresh, but we had \"romantic\" room so we had chocolates and sparkling wine waiting in our room decorated with the rose pedals",
