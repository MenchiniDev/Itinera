The problem is that the whiskey was too strong for me to handle I got red on the face and almost developed hives due to my allergy to alcohol.\n\nThe views from the second floor are something to talk about though!",

It was really hot outside and inside it was so fresh and comfy. As a group visit I strongly recommend it. The menu is filling so don't eat too many tapas before.",

Main course you can see in the picture,except for the one little cherry tomato and 3cm x 1 cm piece of carrot that I ate. The dish was meant to be warm, but was cold, and whatever it was that was supposed to replace the meat was chewy and didn't feel like it was supposed to be eaten. The rest rooms were clean. The dinner started later than the given time. The service took time, when we had eaten the starter at our table, 5 minutes later they still carried out starters. They ran out of sparkling water.",
