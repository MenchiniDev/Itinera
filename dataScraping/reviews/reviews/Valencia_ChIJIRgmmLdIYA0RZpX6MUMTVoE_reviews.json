            "text": "Any Indian who sings paean about paella is lying. Because India is a land of 6000 rice varieties, about 119 rice recipes and salt. Now, imagine the task of impressing taste buds who have danced with that many rice recipes slow cooked in Indian spices with a paella. But one doesn't have to go to Racó del Túria just for their paella, one can indulge in their wine, their house-made wafers, their bread and their desserts, which - by the way - were just heavenly. Plus the atmosphere on a laid back Saturday afternoon in beautiful Valencia made the whole experience, well... wholesome.\nIt's one of those places one should not miss, even if one comes from India.",

We wanted to try the paella and enjoyed that, as well as the croquettes and a sweet potato dessert.\n\nService was initially good but then tailed off a bit as they got busier before improving again.\n\nBe aware that some of the paella dishes need to be ordered in advance.\n\nOverall we were pleased with our decision to eat here and enjoyed our evening.",

We did it all and were disappointed with both of our Paella dishes. The ambiance was nice, and they had a good wine list, this just did not make up for the quality of the food.",

The Croquetas de Jamón, Solomillo con Foie and Tarta de Chocolate were what I had, as shown in the pictures, and I recommend them all. A good choice for either a relaxed group meal or a solo experience.",
