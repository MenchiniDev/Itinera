Quite charming as well but not by any means particularly comfortable.\n\nThe beds are very hard and the AC was not adjustable (except the fan speed but I'm still unsure if it was actually cooling or heating...). You could open the windows but it was quite noisy from a nearby night club.\n\nBreakfast was ok. Not the best selection and the same each day.\n\nI would only recommend this hotel for the price and the location. For a good night's sleep I'd to anywhere else.",

The complimentary bottles of water which were left every day were a nice touch. The noise from the trams didn't bother us too much.\n\nThe breakfasts are amazing with so much choice. My only minor complaint is that a couple of mornings when I asked for fried eggs they arrived somewhat cold.",
