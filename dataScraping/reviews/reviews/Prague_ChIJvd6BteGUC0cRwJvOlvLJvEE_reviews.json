The rooms and en-suites are well appointed and comfortable. The staff are welcoming and there is great attention to detail and to ensuring guests are happy and relaxed; we really felt confident and that we didn't need to worry about anything whilst we were there- everything was always in hand. The breakfast is outstanding. The lounge area was pleasant and provided an optional opportunity to chat to other guests.  We would definitely stay there again.",

Roomy, comfortable accommodations with an outstanding staff dedicated to making your stay not only pleasant but exceptional. Since our stay was but two nights and we wanted to see as much of Prague as possible the hotel staff arranged for a guide to spend several hours with us to hit the hot spots and give us suggestions for further exploration. Perfect! And the restaurant is outstanding in selection, service and atmosphereâ€¦..the view at dinner, watching the sun set and Prague begin to twinkle before our eyes was only surpassed by the outstanding tasting menu, wonderful wine selection and incredible service! SIX STARS for all: accommodations, food, service and experience. Thanks for all!",

Twelve minute stroll to the legendary Charles Bridge. Accommodating and helpful staff. Nice touches in the rooms--towel warmers, warming units in bathroom floor, lots of upscale shampoos, lotions, etc. Super comfy bed and pillows. The breakfast was nothing short of outstanding and so was the service staff. There is a considerable buffet of cold items and you order hot dishes from the menu-- as many as you want!",
