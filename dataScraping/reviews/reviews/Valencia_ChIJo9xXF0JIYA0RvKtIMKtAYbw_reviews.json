It is also more delicious and pleasant than the surrounding restaurants.\n\nTwo nights in this hotel was a very good experience and reasonably priced service. I will be back again.",

If you can sleep through noise then this place is great.\n\nLocation is great for the beach but bad if you want to sleep at any time of the day or night.\nAlso there is a terrace which is great but it is closed, and apparently has been for a long time.",

One of my favorite upgrades is the lovely fragrance of the shampoo, conditioner and soap. They all come in very handy refill flacons.  Very ecological friendly.  Also compliments to the very kind and capable staff of the hotel.\n'Till next year!\n\nJoop and Jeannette",
