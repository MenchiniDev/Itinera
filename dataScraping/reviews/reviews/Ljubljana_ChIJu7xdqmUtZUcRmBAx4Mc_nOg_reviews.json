The diversity of flavours in the dishes was stunning, and the recommendations added a special touch to the entire experience. The salmon, in particular, left a lasting impression. We will definitely be returning as we felt truly welcomed and pampered. Thank you to the restaurant for a memorable experience!",

            "text": "Good option for Asian cuisine in Ljubljana. Itâ€™s primarily Thai but you can also find options from other places like Japan, Vietnam, etc. we started with the Vietnamese chicken rolls and the sliced tuna starters. Then headed on with the miso soup and finished with the ginger marinated salmon and the thai curry prawns. All our dishes were great but the salmon was fabulous. Good service and great Slovenian wine selection.",

            "text": "Solid upscale Thai food option in Ljubljana.\nWe started with Tom Yum soup and Indonesian salad. Both delicious.\nFor entrees, we had the red curry with chicken and Prawns with Singaporean sauce. Both were well spiced and solid.\nWhat I didn't like was the fact that the prawns had the shells on. An upscale restaurant should clean the shrimp so patrons are not forced to dig out shrimp from their saucy dish and peel them- it was very messy. They did provide wet napkins for cleanup but this should not have been necessary. I understand the shrimp shells help with the flavor of the dish- but there are ways to use the shells after they have been removed from the prawns\nThey had a few craft beers on the menu and the wine options were decent.\nI STRONGLY recommend getting reservations. While I sat there, the staff turned away no less than a dozen potential patrons - even though there were many empty seats.\nSolid 4 stars.",
