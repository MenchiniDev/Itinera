The salad leaves looked a little on the older side, but that didn't really affect the taste. The fajitas were good and everything we expected of the dish. The servers were very friendly, and the service overall was great.",

            "text": "This Hard Rock Cafe is in an excellent spot at the Valletta Waterfront. I would recommend the outdoor seating, although live music is indoors. We ordered bbq bacon cheeseburger (had the patty medium rare and enjoyed it), salmon caesar salad (which is of really good serving size, can be shared by 2 people. The salmon was cooked although I had the initial expectation that it would be smoked) and the ribs (which was excellent! Had the half rack and was shared by 2 people). A wide range of beverages was available and had the strawberry basil lemonade (which they said is a crowd favorite) â€” a must try. Service was nothing but amazing. I highly commend Muhammad Ali â€” excellent service from start to end. Very accommodating, helpful, of pleasing personality and is a great photographer/videographer. Also commend the managerâ€™s professionalism, Amjahd. Overall great experience.",

So, whichever drink you order you get one free. Itâ€™s a great deal.\n\nThereâ€™s also an outdoor seating area by the Marina where you can enjoy the views.",

Imagine going here on your lunch break. Their supervisor actually approached us but it seems he didn't understand why we were not happy of the food. The first and last time going here. Not recommended.",
