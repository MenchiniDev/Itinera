            "text": "Berns Hotel was a bit of a disappointment for us. While the pictures on their website showcase a grand entrance, a spacious hall, and a beautiful park, the reality is quite different. The entrance you see in the images is actually for the Asiastika restaurant, which is fantastic, and the nightclub. The hotel entrance is located on a small street and looks rather ordinary.\n\nOur room was decent, but it had a definite 90s vibe. However, the bed was incredibly comfortable, which was a major plus. The breakfast served in the restaurant was good and satisfying.\n\nPrice-wise, Berns Hotel is reasonable, especially if you can catch a good deal. Overall, while the hotel has its positives, it falls short of the expectations set by its online presence.",

The breakfast was tasty but seemed to be poorly organised as only one waiter was working. We had to wait 10 minutes for some clean plates, some of the foods and juices were not refilled and most tables were full of the plates left by the previous guests.",
