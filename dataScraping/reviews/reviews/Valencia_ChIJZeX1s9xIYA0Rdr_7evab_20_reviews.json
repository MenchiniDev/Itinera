It’s a local place and is super clean and the service is amazing. It was a great choice and highly recommended!",

One would expect someone who works in the food industry of any kind to know the basic differences between food diets and restrictions. It has been stated that one person of the group is vegetarian and we made sure even one more time that the food does not include meat. However, we have been served a dish with fish and after reporting this fact we have been basically laughed at bacause, you know, 'fish is not meat, right'.\nHopefully after this unpleasant incident the staff will eventually figure out the difference between veganism, vegetarianism and pesceterianism. When in doubt Google is always a helpful tool! ;))",
