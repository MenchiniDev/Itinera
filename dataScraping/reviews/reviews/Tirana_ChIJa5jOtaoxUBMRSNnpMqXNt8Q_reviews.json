The room we stayed in was lovely, cozy and super clean. Great free breakfast buffet is another beautiful thing. The restaurant was open until 11pm and the menu was incredible. Fantastic chef! I was there with my family and we stayed for 13 days. Everything you need is around the area. 15 min walk and you are right downtown of Tirana. We are very very satisfied with our stay at the Classic Hotel in Tirana and we will be back soon. Five stars baby....",
