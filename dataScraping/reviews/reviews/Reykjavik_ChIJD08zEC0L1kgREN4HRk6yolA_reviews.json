Delicious food, excellent service and great to be able to find authentic halal food from Pakistan in the city. Lots of options on the menu including sharing platters, specials. Prices are reflective of Reykjavik and Iceland generally so expect to pay more but it's worth it. The staff were brilliant, sharing info on the community in the city and exchanging stories from Pakistan. Worth a visit for anyone looking for traditional Pakistani or halal food. Longest established Pakistani restaurant in city.",

I was greeted with warm smiles and excellent customer service that made me feel instantly at home.\n\nThe food at Shalimar is a testament to the chef's dedication and passion, with each dish crafted from the heart. The flavors are rich, the ingredients are high-quality, and the authenticity is palpable in every bite.\n\nFrom the succulent kebabs, aromatic biryanis to the, each dish reminds the food in Lahore Pakistan.\n\nThe ambiance adds to the experience, offering a cozy and welcoming vibe that makes it perfect for a relaxing dining experience. Shalimar Cuisine is truly a hidden gem, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and delicious Pakistani dining experience in Reykjavik.",
