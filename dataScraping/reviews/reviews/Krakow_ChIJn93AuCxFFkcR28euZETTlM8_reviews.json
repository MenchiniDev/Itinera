Once there was no light in the room for a while... Overall, it was not a positive experience at all and I shall not stay here again unless I have to as there are way better offers in Krakow.",

I had no rights to cancel the reservation, but I called the hotel to explain and they were very professional and understanding, voluntarily refunding 80% of the prepayment. I have a really positive impression of the way they handled this problem and I will certainly try Hotel Justyna next time I have the opportunity.",
