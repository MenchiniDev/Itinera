We got a guided breakfast tour the first morning, and breakfast itself was very good with a lot of options.\nThe room was comfy with one of the nicer views I've had from a hotel room, at least in the evening.\nThe spa was okay but still a big plus, the regular sauna was good but the steam sauna was to cold for my opinion.",

            "text": "The hotel is at a nice location, quite quick access from airport. The views from higher floors were stunning. What can be improved is when they check in guests they can give heada up that the rooms are not ready before 15:00 o’clock, as well as they can check the air conditioning more regularly. For example there was a particular room where it wasn’t working so it was quite cold, and the alternative to it was to provide me with small radiator - which simply wasn’t enough for the sq.m. Of the room.\nDespite all above the staff is well mannered and quick to react and support. The Spa is small for the size of the hotel.",

Shout out to the new guy. Went daily breakfast at the quarter where the lovely Nigerian lady was great conversation and honestly the best part of my experience. My only complaint was the room light switches. There was not a dim setting, either all or nothing, and at first my reading lights were broken but they quickly fixed them.",

Fast internet speed, definitely better than many similar hotels. Nice service in the lobby. Quite tasty breakfast, there is something for everyone.",

I highly recommend requesting a room on the highest floor available to fully enjoy the panoramic view of the city and the sea.\n\nThe overall experience was excellent. I made daily use of the well-equipped gym, which boasts a wide range of equipment, and the spa facilities. The sauna, steam bath, and the impressive pool on the 11th floor are simply astonishing.\n\nTry the restaurant at the top floor.",
