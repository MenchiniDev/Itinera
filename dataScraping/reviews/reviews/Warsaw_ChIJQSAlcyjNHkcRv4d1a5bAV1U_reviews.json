Before coming i read a comment about the need to order extras separately (sauce/sour cream, onions), which is indeed the case and I recommend ordering something on top of dumplings as otherwise they'll come plain, which is not to everyone's taste. I really liked everything and I recommend to come and enjoy good food and drinks.",
