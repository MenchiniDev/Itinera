The great location of the hotel and the relatively helpful staff can't make up for the small rooms where everything can be heard. Not to mention the dirty walls.",

The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Every morning we had a good breakfast with some alternating vegetarian options available. This hotel is really conveniently located - you can get to just about anywhere from there via walking or the trams. Really enjoyed our stay here.",
