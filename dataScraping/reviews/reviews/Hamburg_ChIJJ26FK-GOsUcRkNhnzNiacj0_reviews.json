Location is very well positioned right across from main train stations. you can even drop off your luggage at the receptionist for free and walk around all day long in the city hotel will also give you three days free pass on the public transportation.",

            "text": "This is a really standard business hotel that has no character or anything unique about it. It's not crappy but it's not beautiful. I booked a couple hours before arrival at a really peak point where there was almost no rooms available in the city. I paid for eur431 for a very small room with a single bed that smelled like cigarettes on the very back of the building. For me, the group should not have cost more than $40. I did however knowing Lee book the room and I am thankful that I had a roof over my head. The staff was professional but not memorable. When I complained about how much I paid and asked for a discount, they were not able to address me in any kind of nice way. They just changed the topics. On the other hand, it steps from the main station which was very convenient. The breakfast was huge and it was good. It was not the best one I ever had but it was definitely big with lots of choices. The bar was kind of cool looking and they had piano playing really late at night. I didn't want to go there in the beginning but when I came home at night from another place I read it that I didn't have a drink there just to enjoy the piano. There's a nice hotel near with a really nice bar a few doors down",
