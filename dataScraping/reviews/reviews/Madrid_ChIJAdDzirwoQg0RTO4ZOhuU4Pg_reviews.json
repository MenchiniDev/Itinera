No communication, complete silence and ignoring. Rude! We never managed to try the food because we looked for a place with friendlier people. Fortunately, there are many restaurants in Madrid with good food, polite service and a pleasant atmosphere, and there is no need to waste time and nerves with this particular restaurant.",
