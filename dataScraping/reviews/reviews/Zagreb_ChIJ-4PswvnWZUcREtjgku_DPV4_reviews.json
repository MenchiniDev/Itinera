Fabulous rooms, unbelievably comfortable beds, great amenities, rooms well stocked (I loved that each room had a universal travel adaptor for guests so thoughtful). 10/10 would stay here again in a heartbeat.",

We went to the lovely bar and then proceeded to wait for 90 minutes to get a drink and some food.  I finally got frustrated and returned to reception and the then gave me a room key.\nNice room, but AC was barely functioning.   Reported it with no resolution.\nThe worst part was that there was a very loud party complete with amplification, on a courtyard directly below our room. We asked and the desk told us we should have been notified about the party, but nothing could or would be done.  They said they had lots of complaints but no solution.\n\nNo sleep until after 23:00.\nNo apologies, just said we should have known.\n\nNot 5 star treatment at any level.\nWe paid for  a suite and instead got a dance party.\n\nAvoid at all costs...",
