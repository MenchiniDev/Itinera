Prices were reasonable too.\nWould absolutely recommend.",

There is a proper pizza oven as well, so you can rest assured that your pizza will be 100% amazing. I got pea soup and a salad and both of them were cooked incredibly well! I would recommend coming here!",

Tagliatelle portobello contains chicken meat, which might be surprising for vegetarians. Service was neither very fast nor well organized. Place was spacious and had cozy atmosphere inside. Coperto of 70 ALL charged per person. All in all, nice place. Recommended.",
