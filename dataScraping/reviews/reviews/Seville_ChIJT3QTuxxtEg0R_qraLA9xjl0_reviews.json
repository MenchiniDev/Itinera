            "text": "A marvelous place, don't miss out...BOOK. There are many options, outside tables, inside tables, standing in the bar. An impressive choice of tapas and a very good menu. I confess we had both, started in the bar, standing ordering tapas and ended up sitting outside for an excellent lunch. It was a sunny but cool December afternoon and we were eating for HOURS. Jamon at the bar and the crisp, tiny shrimp tortillas, typical from Sanlucar, washed down with chilled Manzanilla wine. Then a lunch of tiny broad beans (habitas) with jamon, grilled vegetables with Romesco sauce, squid in ink, pork cheeks and rice, tiny lamb chops. We washed it down with good but reasonably priced red wine and then decided to have more wine and a plate of tangy manchego cheese. We finished with a very necessary double round of coffees and a good quality local brandy (Terry). The bill was only 40 € per head, which is very reasonable for the fantastic quality that we enjoyed. Antonio, our waiter, was prompt, helpful and extremely professional. We will be back!!!",

The fideos marinera wasn't that good, but the star of our order was the sangre encebollada (blood cakes in an onion tomato sauce)\n\nTheir tortillitas de camarones (prawn fritter) was super crispy and super light.\n\nSit in the bar area for the tapas, there's more formal dining outside and inside.",
