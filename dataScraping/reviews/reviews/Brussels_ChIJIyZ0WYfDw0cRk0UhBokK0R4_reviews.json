That changed when an obnoxious group of Brits/Scots came in quite drunk. Workers didn‚Äôt seem too happy about it. Anyway, I had a jug of sweet lambic and I wasn‚Äôt a fan. It was enjoyable but the dry and funky lambics are my preferred version of the style. Workers weren‚Äôt super friendly, seemed rather bored. Interior was unique, place was down a narrow alley, maybe I visited at the wrong time. I would suggest you go to form your own opinion!",

            "text": "Stumbled across this place while exploring the city. It's tucked away between a hemp shop and a waffle shop down a narrow alley. Really feels like you've been transported back in time. The bar is really small so fills up quickly.\n\nWe tried the malange beers, really fruit and delicious especially if you are nursing a hangover. You get 2 jugs and whatever flavour you choose and mix them in your glass. This sounds terrible but it was a real pallette cleanser after drinking Belgian beers.\n\nI hate the term but it's a hidden gem and probably my most favorite find during my visit.",
