There was a separate section for  underaged people near the stage, so they could feel comfy.\nAt the main zone there is a bar with good beer and polite staff. Note, that the cloakroom service is not free. The fee is about 3‚Ç¨. You can pay by card here.",

The exhibition was informative and well-presented.\n\nHowever, my experience was marred by an encounter with an older gentleman who informed me that dogs were not allowed in the museum. As a responsible dog owner and trainer, my two medium-sized dogs were leashed and well-behaved by my side. I requested to see a sign indicating this policy, as such notices are typically displayed at entrances.\n\nThe gentleman responded rudely, insisting, \"It's on the internet, and anyway, you should know.\" I pointed out that there was no URL or signage at the entrance indicating their policy. Despite my polite attempt to discuss the matter, he insisted I leave immediately.\n\nI left written feedback suggesting they clearly display a sign about their no-dog policy at the entrance to avoid future misunderstandings.\n\nIn summary, while the exhibition itself was enjoyable and well-organized, the experience was significantly detracted by the rude and unwelcoming attitude of the staff member, which dampened the overall atmosphere.",
