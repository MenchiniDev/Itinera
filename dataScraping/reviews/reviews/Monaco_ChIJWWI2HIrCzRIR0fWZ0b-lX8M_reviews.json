Tagliatelle a la Truffe was also incredibly good, but too much for me after a couple bites. Bruschetta was refreshing and tasty.\n\nIt was packed during peak lunch hour but we were able to get seats immediately because it was almost closing (closes 2PM). Seems to be quite popular among locals and tourists alike.",
