I chose a vegetarian option that reminded me of a quiche, and it was quite good. The waiter was friendly, and the place had a cozy atmosphere. Although we hadn’t made a reservation and were seated in the smoking area, which wasn’t ideal, the overall experience remained enjoyable. They also propose prayers before and after dinner, adding a unique touch to the experience.",

            "text": "Wow, this is definitely a hidden gem in Sofia. The place is beautiful and super Instagrammable, it really feels like you're in a Bulgarian village with traditional Bulgarian decorations.\n\nWhen we arrived, it seemed like the restaurant was about to close since it was a public holiday, but they still served us and seated us in the VIP section, which made the dinner feel really warm and family-like with my friends who are Bulgarian and from the Czech Republic. We were given welcome Pita Bread and a few tasting drinks. The service was excellent, and the food prices matched the portion, presentation, and the restaurant's ambiance. I highly recommend this one!",
