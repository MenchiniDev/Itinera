            "text": "Great location just minutes from train, Don, and shopping. Plenty of food and shopping very accessible. Rooms are spacious, spotless and handicap accessible. Staff is welcoming and very kind. Ask for a courtyard view as streets nearby are very busy and there is construction next door that starts very early. Remember you are in a senior living apartment complex so be respectful of the permanent residents. This is NOT the hotel to bring large groups of loud people to! Apartment had a fridge with small freezer (we made ice!!!) and dishes and silverware for 4 along with an oven and small appliances like a coffee pot. There is also a cooktop and basic pots. Water pressure in shower is great and bathroom was quite large. Balcony with table and chairs and a small dining set gave us plenty of room to sit. No air conditioning but big windows and good airflow really helped a lot.",

Rooms and furnishings are very spacious but a little dated, but at the price a good proposition for a longer stay - especially compared to other options.",

We loved this place cuz be with elders and say hello to them is priceless. Also u have to test for corona when you check in but it’s free of charge but if you wanna use pool u have to test every 24 hours. If they improve internet this place way better than hilton:)",
