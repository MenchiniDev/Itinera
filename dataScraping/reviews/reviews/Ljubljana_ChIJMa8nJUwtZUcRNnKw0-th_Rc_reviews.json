Restaurant was good place to eat dinner also.\nEven it's not in centrum, buss goes like every 10 minutes so it's easy to move around the city.\nI highly recommend! And definitely I will stay here again next time I visit Ljubljana ðŸ˜Š",

Nice clean rooms, nice location with a pub/restaurant at the ground floor, the host was very friendly and helpfull, speaks English. Parking is not a problem regardless of the hour of arrival, a few minutes away from the interstate. For me it was the perfect location. Oh, and has a really nice breakfast with lots to choose from, you won't leave hungry.",
