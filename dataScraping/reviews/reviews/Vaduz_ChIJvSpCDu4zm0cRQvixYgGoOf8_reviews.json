The crust served as plain bread sticks was also delicious.  The sauce and cheese was perfectly balanced with the other toppings.  The salad was the same. Two people shared a pizza and salad and were well satisfied. The pizza is huge, but thin. If you eat a lot, it is still easy to finish your own pie.",
