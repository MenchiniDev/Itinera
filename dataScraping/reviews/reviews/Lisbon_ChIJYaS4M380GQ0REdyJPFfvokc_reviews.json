The octopus was made to perfection, and so was the meat.\n\nThe only thing we didnâ€™t like was the dessert, because of the strawberry jello like texture.",

            "text": "Amazing food and service! We were so happy to have gotten a reservation at this place; we ordered the garlic shrimp as an appetizer with bread, octopus and steak as our mains and ordered a truffle linguine as a side to the steak. All of the food was AMAZING. Bread was a great assortment and came with olive oil and pate; the octopus was a little salty but goes great with the snow pea and potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection and hit the spot. Definitely worth it and the staff and ambiance was perfect. Definitely try this place!!",

The duck and rice tasted flavorful, my favourite was the pork which the waiter said was his favourite! The staff were amazing, polite and attentive, very professional.\n\nI canâ€™t quite understand some of the earlier unhappy comments by customers, but we were glad to have walked into this classy restaurant on our very first night in Lisbon and have the wonderful dishes, so delicious and well prepared! Thanks for a wonderful dinner Sacramento and staff!",
