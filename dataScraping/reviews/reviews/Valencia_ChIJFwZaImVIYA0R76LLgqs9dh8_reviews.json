            "text": "El Bobo is located right by the beach, offering amazing views of the sea. Some would regard these as ‘tourist traps’, but all I can say is that we experienced good service and food. Did like the white table cloths, which makes it feel a bit more special. It is located at the end of stretch, so is a bit quieter.\n\nThe prices are good and a lot like the other places in the area. We ordered a mix paella for two (rabbit, chicken and seafood) and it was delicious. The lunch was finished off with a complimentary vodka lemon sorbet.\n\nOn an earlier visit, I had a simple grilled hake.",
