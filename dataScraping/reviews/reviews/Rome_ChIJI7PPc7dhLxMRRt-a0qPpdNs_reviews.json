The menu is very robust but the servings and timing of each course was perfect!\n\nI normally ALWAYS have left overs. My sister and I tried both the seafood and meat first course … they were both great!\n\nBook your reservation in advanced! It’s worth it.",

The food was amazing – the pasta with cheese and the pesto pasta were both delicious. The tropical non-alcoholic cocktail was refreshing and perfect for a warm day. The service was exceptional, and the terrace has a wonderful atmosphere. Thank you very much for an unforgettable experience!",

We were exhausted after touring the Colosseum and wanted to sit down to have a nice meal.\nSo lucky to find a seat by the window to enjoy the view of the Colosseum!\nWe didn’t expect much but got blown away by the food when it came out. Not only presentation was beautiful but the food was so tasty.\nShrimp appetizer was wrapped with noodles and it was so crispy but inside was moist. Octopus was warm and accompanied with special pepper, fennel, and orange sauce. It was packed with flavor.\n\nDessert was WOW moment. We got the tasting sampler mignon and it was so pretty to eat. Pistachio, passion fruit w coco, strawberry vanilla and triple chocolate w cookies. We don’t even like sweets but we enjoyed to the last bite.\n\nPrice is very reasonable. Staff are friendly but you need to get their attention if you want more drinks or check.\n\nIt was an amazing dining experience and highly recommend this place when you come to Rome.",
