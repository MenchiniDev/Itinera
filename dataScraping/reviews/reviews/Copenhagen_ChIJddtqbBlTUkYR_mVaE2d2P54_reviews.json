We were on floor 5 (there is a lift) and it was quiet. There is a secure luggage room. There is a free wine between 5-6pm! The location is great.",

From brown water, to a broken toilet, the sink not working, 1/10th of a shower head working and maintenance walking in on you without knocking. The only positive from my duration is the location, but this does not make up for the hassle we’ve had to deal with. Strongly do not recommend.",

So it is a great value for the price.\nWould recommend for sure!",
