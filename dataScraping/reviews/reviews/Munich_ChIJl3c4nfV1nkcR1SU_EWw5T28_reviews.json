The mixed starter was excellent with different flavours and textures. The ravioli dish of the day was delicious and the buckwheat pancakes also very good. The chocolate mousse dessert was absolutely not a disappointment! üòã\nThe staff were friendly and helpful - although we had to ask three times for a glass of water.",

The staff spoke English and was very friendly and helpful. They were attentive and the food came relatively quickly. The vegan food was delicious and satisfying - I had curry and pasta for the main course, and a decadent dessert with cappuccino. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great vegetarian dining experience in Munich.",
