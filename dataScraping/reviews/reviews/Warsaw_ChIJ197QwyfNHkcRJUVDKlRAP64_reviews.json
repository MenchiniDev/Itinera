The food is tasty but a bit overpriced in my opinion (considering the look and the interior of the place etc.). The place does not have a 'wow-factor' for me but I would definitely go back, especially between 9:00-10:00 when they serve any breakfast for 18.00PLN!:-) Overall score: solid 4 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐",

For the food and coffees we paid almost 200zl that is much more than in other cafes. The dishes were more like random ingredients in the plates not like meals. Not recommended at all.",
