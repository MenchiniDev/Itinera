            "text": "Our room here was so comfortable and nice, the terrace was so inviting, a private sunny refuge with a lime tree growing on it. The show stopper is the view from the small restaurant. It;s a spectacular view of all the yachts parked near Monaco. The staff treated us great, and the breakfast was wonderful. although way too much food.  We did not get a chance to eat dinner at the hotel, but would expect it to be just as good. This is not a hotel you should stay at if you have mobility issues. It was two sets of steep (one twisting) stairs, then another two sets outside, just to get to our room. I can't imagine it work for people with small children or mobility issues.",

Rooms are romantic and beds are comfortable which is not always the case in France. The walk to the beach is about 6 minutes. Again, wonderful hotel only 7 rooms which is nice.",
