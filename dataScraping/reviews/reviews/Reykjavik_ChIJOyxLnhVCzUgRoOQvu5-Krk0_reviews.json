Despite the fact that you're going to see lots of penises, is really interesting. I highly recommend to give yourself 1 hour or so to visit this museum, have some fun and learn something too.",

            "text": "Of course, we went for the jokes. But it turned out to be a truly academic experience as well. I would say the oddity of someone collecting this particular feature of anatomy is as big a draw as the actual collection. It’s the train wreck - you feel you must look. But then, when you’re in there, it’s pretty fascinating. I also think it’s somewhat intriguing because there’s no way there could be a vagina museum. People wouldn’t go. Simply not as interesting. So there’s a bit of joy in finally finding a collection of male-sex-related gawking material. Glad for it.",

Be prepared to see over 80 animal phalluses and some human ones too. The gift shop at the end is adorable, too. I would recommend it to my friends if they visit Iceland.\n\nAlso, there’s a cafe inside with a couple food items, drinks, and hot beverages.",
