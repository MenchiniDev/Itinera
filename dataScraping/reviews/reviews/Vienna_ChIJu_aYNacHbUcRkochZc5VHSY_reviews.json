The breakfast buffet is delicious! All of your staff was friendly and helpful. My room had everything I needed too. I'm already planning on coming back next year! I'm the guest that had the little mini printer and had fun gifting your staff with a picture to thank them.",

The rooms are quiet, large and dark when you want them to be. We had more than one room and they put us next door. The rooms were cleaned every day- one time twice! It is very close to transportation, stores and shops but not as expensive or crowded as the tourist section just a short walk away. There is vintage shopping, a grocery store, a health food store, an apothecary and more just a few doors down. We have been traveling for months and staying here was a treat to ourselves. I am writing this review in their library. It's a great hotel with so much to offer. Thank you Hotel Stefanie for our restful  and quiet stay. We loved it.",

However, the room they gave me has only one single bed since I’m alone. It was really hot inside the room, even though it’s cold outside. I asked for air conditioning, but the staff member told me it’s October and that all the AC units are not working and Because of this, I couldn't sleep properly since it was too hot for me.\n\nThe receptionist had poor customer service, and my complaint went unaddressed.",
