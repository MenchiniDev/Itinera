All of the dishes were good but I was a little bummed by the service and atmosphere, which was a little slammed with tourists, so I get it. I'd say come here for a great beer (which is their specialty) and a decent traditional German meal on the side. But there are better schnitzels and sausages in the area if you're looking for something cozier or tasty. The service was friendly though and we were overall happy we tried it out.",
