Hotel staff arranged parking for 20 Euros at a secure car park around the corner and came out and got our bags from car when we couldn't get a park in the hotel's street. Very quiet too.\nHighly recommend.",

The hotel, overall, is clean and has a great restaurant and roof. The rooms are spacious as well, but we had an issue with the smell in ours. We noticed when we would leave the room and return, it would smell vile. We were able to trace this to the shower drain but were never able to get rid of the smell during out stay.",

And don‚Äôt miss out on the rooftop bar! We can‚Äôt wait to stay again on our next trip to Munich!",
