Weâ€™re in Monaco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨\nAll the dish had a perfect blend of flavors.\nA harmonious blend of flavors wrapped around my tongue that I could never have imagined beyond.\nWe ate some dish and we wept.ðŸ˜‚\nThe emotional touched always seems to come in unexpected situations.\nIn addition, even the Brahms Symphony, which sounds calm inside the restaurant, made me ecstatic.\nAll the staff provided impeccable and thoroughly examined me and my husbandâ€™s reactions.\nThe staff pre-checked my husbandâ€™s birthday and served for him chocolate cake as a surprise, and we were deeply moved !!! ðŸ¥¹\n\nThank you very much.ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·\nMerci beaucoup.ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·",

The food was well presented that covers land and sea with fresh ingredients.  Couple of dishes we really liked such as the shrimp and caviar appetizer and the lamb dish as entree. However overall food tastes were not impressive. I am surprised that this restaurant keeps its 3 starts for that long. Maybe the stars are for its location and service.",

The restaurant has a limited number of tables in a small area but the ceiling is high and stylish. I can say that this restaurant provided the best service among the restaurants I have been to in my life. The staff were professionals and knew every detail on the menu. We tried the agape menu. The chef also had surprises so the tasting journey was 3 hours. To be honest the plates looked better than it tasted. Some flavors were too strong and we could not eat some of the dishes. It's pricey but worth a visit once. Overall it was an interesting experience.",
