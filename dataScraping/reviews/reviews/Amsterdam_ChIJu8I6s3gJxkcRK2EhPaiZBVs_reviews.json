But everything at Hotel Casa was a tad more thoughtful and a little nicer than expected. Most importantly, the staff was very nice and very helpful. Breakfast was not lavish but of good quality.",

The staff is friendly and competent. Checking in and out are very efficient . The rooms are clean and comfortable. There is no exercise facility in the hotel. The restaurants on the lobby and first floor levels have decent foods. Overall it is a very adequate, clean comfortable hotel with a friendly staff and at a very convenient location.",

The hotel is modern and well-designed, with a pleasant coffee bar and friendly staff.\nHowever, the room lacked air conditioning and had small windows, which made it a bit uncomfortable. The rental bike was also not in the best condition. Despite these issues, I had a pleasant time in Amsterdam overall.",
