Our room was a luxury double and we couldnâ€™t have been happier, the bed was so comfortable and I think we have had our best nights sleep in a long time. The restaurant staff were extremely helpful in adapting their 5 course menu to meet with my dietary needs. The food exceeded our expectations and was matched perfectly to wine that would suit. The hotel location is ideal for sightseeing and we would happily book to stay again. Overall, our stay was amazing! Thank you",

The rooms are extremely comfortable - automatic blinds, televisions in every room including the bathroom mirror, and luxurious beds. Great housekeeping services, too - turn down service, daily cleaning, and complete resetting of all the amenities each day. We can't wait to return!\n\nRight next to Villa Borghese and walkable to all events and sites in central Roma. Plenty of dining, bars nearby.",
