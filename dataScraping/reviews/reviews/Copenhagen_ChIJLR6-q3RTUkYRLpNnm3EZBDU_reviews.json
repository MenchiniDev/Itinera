            "text": "Very nice restaurant with a modern Nordic cuisine. Great flavours and beautiful presentation. I tried 5 courses menu with winepairing. My favourites were mussel soup and waffle with mushrooms, although all 5 dishes were just delicious! Wines - as well!\n\nWorth mentioning their wonderful service! The girls were super nice, presenting every course and every wine, always smiling and creating nice relaxing atmosphere. They were also very flexible and gave me a table when I was quite late to my reservation due to some unforeseen circumstances.\n\nI would definitely come back there and really recommend this place to others due to their delicious food, great service and pleasant atmosphere.\n\nThank you!",
