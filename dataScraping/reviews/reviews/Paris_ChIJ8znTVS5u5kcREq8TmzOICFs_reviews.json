I didn't rate the welcome because we arrived as part of a large group, which is always difficult for everyone.  We liked our room, but  several of the electric plugs did not work, and a repair person was not able to fix that.  The staff was friendly and helpful, and our room was very clean.  We enjoyed beautiful two-story windows that opened onto one of two squares inside the hotel property.  Our king bed was comfy and the room had two bathrooms.  One upstairs in the sitting room, and the other downstairs in the bedroom.  The breakfast buffet was good, and included a cappuccino machine.  If you ask for 'American coffee', they will bring it.  The concierge was really helpful!",

The family room was spacious and very comfortable for our family of four (with teen daughters).  The maid service was excellent - supplies always refreshed. Any request ( for an iron etc.) was done in a timely fashion. The concierge was exceptional! We would stay here again and will recommend to family and friends when they visit Paris. Great location- close to major attractions and historic sites.\n\nThank you for making our stay in Paris a memorable one.",
