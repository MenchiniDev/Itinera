The portion of the make your own pasta was big!\n\nCard payments accepted.",

            "text": "Name of place: Public Room.\n\nPublic Room has a massive space, both indoors and outdoors, so I chose to sit outside. The service was impressively fast, and it seemed like a trendy spot for students to hang out. I ordered the meat and bacon wrap, and it arrived quicklyâ€”just 8 minutes and 21 seconds! However, the speed didnâ€™t do any favors for the dish. The cheese wasnâ€™t melted, and the wrap itself had uneven heatâ€”. The meat was disappointingly bland, but I did enjoy the pickled veggies and mayo. The atmosphere was laid-back with chill music, and to top it off, they even threw in a free dessert on the house! Can't complain too much about that!",

            "text": "5 star for Public Room, because one week ago I wrote a review saying that the heating is very low. After few days they changed the heating to a very good level, which I much appreciate, because usually I do my work there and stay for 2-3 hours, and being cold it's not a great feeling. You definitely deserve a 5 star for being absolutely amazing hosts. Also I must say that the food portions are very big which I.Also appreciate very very much . They are not very cheap , but if you calculate how much ingredients they put in them , they are definitely cheap",
