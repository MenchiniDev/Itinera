Little goodies like kettle and bathroom scale, as well as umbrellas when the weather requires it.\nExtremely sweet, helpful and competent staff; delightfully opulent breakfast buffet.\nThis has been for years now our place of choice in Bratislava!",

The rooms are clean and comfortable (except they're a bit out of date, but they tend to modernize step by step and such things takes time). The jacuzzi was cool and they even have bathrobes for the after bath! Big up to the best breakfast we've had in Slovakia in our trip",
