The service was bad - we might have been unlucky with the waiter but there was not a single „bitte“ or „danke“ over the course of the evening - very grumpy. We were a group of eight and we weren’t asked if would like a refill once. The guy was quite unfriendly too.",

There is a huge outdoor area, when you have a nice weather is perfect to enjoy, your are next to the Main river.\nThe place is big enough if you want to go with a large group of people, just is better to do a reservation because at the time of my visit everything was full.\nThe staff is friendly and they are able to speak in English.\nThe menu is international but you will find many traditional German dishes from the Frankfurt area but as well all Germany.\nThe quality of the food is good and the prices are nice for what you get, including the location.\nYou can get as well traditional drinks from the area.",
