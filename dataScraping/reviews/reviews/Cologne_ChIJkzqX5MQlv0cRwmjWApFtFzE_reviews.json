The breakfast is €30 extra, to use the pool is €6 extra, a bathrobe is €3,5. Other than that, the hotel in itself is pretty good.",

Breakfast rates are ridiculous in my opinion. Almost €30,- for a cup of coffee and a bowl of yoghurt is overrated. Parking rates could be less too, imo.",

Also don’t forget to put dnd card on the door because house keeping may enter your room at 8:30. When you complain about it basically what they say is sorry for that but there is nothing we can do. Would I stay there again probably not !",
