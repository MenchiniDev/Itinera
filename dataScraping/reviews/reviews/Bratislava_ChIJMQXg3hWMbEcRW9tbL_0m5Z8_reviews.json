I can imagine to be here often if I would be living in Bratislava.\nThe tower itself is majestic from outside' view, diamond-like shape looks really interesting.\nIn order to get to skies (D floor;) ) you have to pay 3 Euro per person to bar tender at ground floor bar,interesting solution;)\nViews from the top are great, you can see even Vienna.\nRecommended to visit this place once in Bratislava.",

            "text": "The las portion to the tower we did it by foot, there is also public transport and is very accessible. The tower itself is easy to access and the person's at the bottom can instruct you. There is a cost for visiting of 6 €, but if you take main course in the restaurant they will deduct it. As for the view is something breath taking, I would recommend having lunch or dinner since the floor in the sestaurant is rotating while u have your meal and can see all the sides. The staff at the restaurant are as best as a waiter can get. Prices are decent, to bad the menu has a small variety of products that you can chose, but sufficient to cover a decent lunch/dinner.\n\nI would recommend it 100%, it is a experience that u don't get so often.",
