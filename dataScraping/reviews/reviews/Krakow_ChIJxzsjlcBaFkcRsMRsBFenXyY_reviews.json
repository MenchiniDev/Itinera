Good connection with the city center (bus 152 or 502).\nUnfortunately the compliments stop here: the windows aren't properly sealed so you get a nice cold breeze over your head :) and I also had the feeling that the heating wasn't working properly\nWater pressure in the sink and shower were weak, especially the shower :D as the hose was leaking. All in all, with just a small attentions to few details the hotel would be really great!",
