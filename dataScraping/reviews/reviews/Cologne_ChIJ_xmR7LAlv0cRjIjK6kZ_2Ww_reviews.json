The staff went over and above to help us find some specific treats we were looking for, and also to answer questions and help us out.  The restaurant downstairs is convenient as well.",

They let us put our bags down, and they had made up the 3rd pull out bed when we got back, which was nice. The restaurant staff were great and pointed us in the right direction every time. The showers need some grips and are kinda small, but having it in the room is a definite plus!",
