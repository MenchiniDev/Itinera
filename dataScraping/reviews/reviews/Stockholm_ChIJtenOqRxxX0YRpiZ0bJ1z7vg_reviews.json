Lack of hospitality since booking and even worse during check in process (glad someone else step into to help and ask for my reservation details). Hotel gives the idea of spa, without offering any additional services nor amenities. Location is ok but for a short trip, probably would recommend a place closer to the city center.",

Great location, quiet but lots within walking distance. would highly recommend",
