We ordered the vegetarian and diavola pizza, and these are some of the best pizzas I have ever had. The total bill for 2 pizzas and 3 beer was around 17 Euros, which was very reasonable.\n\nThe menu was available in English. The service was ok. The waiter knows some sort of English but not fluently. Overall, it's a recommended restaurant to visit in Podgorica.",

They speak english, this is always a pro when you are traveling.\n\nYou might have place to park just in front of the restaurant. Only negative point is that their menu is in their local language, but it‚Äôs normal since you are in their country (Just use google to check).\n\nIn the picture you have ‚ÄòSvinjska koljenica‚Äô, and I‚Äôm sure you can ask the waiter for some recommendations.",
