They let people organising parties with drinks and food in the hallway and pretend it's normal.\nFor the price paid, it's not even worth it... for 80 euros, you'll find something better in Vilnius.\nWill never go back although I regularly visit this city.",

But the price is also cheap. Good connection with city centre by public transport, ticket cost 1 euro you can buy from bus driver.\nRooms are small, but still you have one soap, shampoo, teapot and fridge.\nBreakfast also small variety. But good and tasty food. Don’t expect too much and everything will be fine",

Nevertheless there wasn’t a “please do not disturb” sign in the room and I personally find it a big waste of energy when once used towles, soap ect habe been replaced with new ones.",
