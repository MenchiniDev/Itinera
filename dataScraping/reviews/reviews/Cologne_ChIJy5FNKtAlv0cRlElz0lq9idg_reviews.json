            "text": "Fantastic!\nFirst, I came here for business trip and was worried that I didn’t get a hotel near city center. Only to find out that local public transportation is just a few minutes walk away.\nSecond, I visited Cologne with my family and I’m glad they offered us a family suite on short notice.. over the years, I only stay at this hotel if possible.\n\nIn general, the staff is great. The receptionists are very friendly, helpful and answer all your questions. The rooms are clean and bright, and will check out the Sauna next time. The breakfast buffet is extraordinary and offers everything you can think of.\nFirst time, every time. Will be coming back!",

The breakfast was good and in an old swimming pool. Only complaint would be the parking garage. It is tiny. It's probably no more than 30 spaces down there.",

Breakfast buffet very generous and yummy with a lot of choices.\nOnly problem for us were the blankets for the king size bed that were definitely not fit for the bed and very short.\nYou can have parking for your car. 18 euros per day.\nIn terms of location, you can be in the city centre in around 15/20min walking, so not bad at all.",
