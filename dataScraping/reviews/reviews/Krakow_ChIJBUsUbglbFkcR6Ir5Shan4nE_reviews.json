            "text": "What can I say? 5 stars doesn't do this perfectly located, comfortable and stylish hotel justice. We stayed in room 25, for 3 nights and had the best time. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious, the reception staff bent over backwards to help, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel smelled amazing, not sure if it was to do with the spa or not. The hotel is very quiet at night, rooms come with heating and air con should you choose to use it, we didn't. If you require an extra pillow, reception will sort it. Also, the safes are in the laundry room which is securely locked and only reception can access that room. They arrange taxi transfers too for 130PLN which is about £25 one way, so for £50 round trip, it's worth it and saves so much hassle.\nThis hotel is truly great and my wife and I cannot wait to go back. Thank you so much for making our stay so wonderful.",

            "text": "Overall a positive experience. We had to change rooms as the first one was incredibly hot and the windows only opened a small amount (and no in room fan or working climate control this time of year). The reception staff moved us to a different room, equally as warm but with windows that opened to cool it off.\nLocation is really good, a few minute walk to the trams. We had breakfast included and it was a good spread.",

Just 100 meters away, there is a Starbucks and a small market open until 23.  There is also a nearby stop for bus transportation.  The room was comfortable.  Breakfast was adequate.

The really impressive part was the breakfast--a true feast with different proteins, veggies, fruits, and different baked goods/pastries each day. Equally impressive was the helpfulness of the staff, especially the receptionist who was just as kind and cheerful to visitors who mistook this address for their actual hotel as she was to the paying guests.",
