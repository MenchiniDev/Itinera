And it's comparatively in that area pretty expensive I think it was 12eu for breakfast which is a lot. It's kosher which that means everything else is expensive but if you want authentic kosher Jewish food this is a place to go",

            "text": "I couldn't contain my excitement as I eagerly anticipated savoring my sandwich. However, my anticipation quickly turned into disappointment when I unveiled it during my flight back home. The saying \"pictures speak a thousand words\" couldn't be more accurate in this case. It's disheartening to see such a lackluster representation of what was promised. Considering the price I paid, I had hoped for a much better experience.\n\nTo say that the schnitzel was dry would be a gross understatement. Its moisture level was severely lacking, leaving me longing for a more succulent and flavorful filling. Moreover, there was a perplexing addition of what appeared to be a cucumber‚Äîthough I cannot be certain‚Äîand an unidentified ingredient that might have been an onion, but it was rather unclear. This mishmash of components did not live up to my expectations.\n\nIf you're curious about the true representation of my disappointment, I urge you to take a look at the attached picture in this review. Regrettably, that was the unfortunate reality of what I received.",
