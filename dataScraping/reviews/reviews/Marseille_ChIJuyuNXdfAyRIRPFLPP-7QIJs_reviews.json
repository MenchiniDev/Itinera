I can't speak to that being the first time I've ever had it. But is it worth the 80 Euros they charge? No. Is it the best food I've ever had? No. Would I go back? No. But...I'm glad I went and if I wanted to give someone an experience in Marseille they won't forget, I would absolutely come back for that. But if you're just looking for the best food you can get in Marseille, I would go elsewhere.",

There are simply 2 starters (fish soup and fried squids) and 3 main dishes (Boulliabaisse, Bourride and catch of the day). Everything is really good and the fish is ultra fresh. For sure the best Bouillabaisse in Marseille, which is The regional dish.",
