The only thing that I think could be better are the beds, they are a bit too firm and hard for my taste.",

Although the rooms weren't overly spacious, they were stylish and gave off a charming harbor and sea vibe. However, the one downside was the construction site right in front of the building, which brought noise and occasional odors. But, fingers crossed, once that's over, this place will be perfect! Can't wait to potentially update my review then.",

            "text": "I was disappointed with my stay at the 25hours HafenCity. The hotel felt very dark and not in such a good state but that was not the main issue. My night was disrupted by intense corridor noise and construction outside the building in front of the hotel, which was not communicated beforehand neither compensated in any way. Additionally, housekeeping entered my room twice despite the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, intruding on my privacy. The stay did not reflect the standards expected for the price paid and my membership level. I hope the hotel addresses these issues for future guests.",
