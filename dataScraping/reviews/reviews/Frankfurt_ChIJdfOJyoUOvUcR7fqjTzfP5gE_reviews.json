The rooms still don't have adequate lighting,\nbut my room this time was a world better than the first time I stayed.  The staff at breakfast made me feel thoroughly looked after and they made adjustments during the week to cater for my Coeliac disease.\n\nI'll look forward to staying again.",

Oh and what's with the vampire-style lighting where i can see a thing in my room? I get the bar atmosphere... but you should have a dimmer or something in rooms to allow for full lights on. Wi-Fi not great either. Not impressed.",
