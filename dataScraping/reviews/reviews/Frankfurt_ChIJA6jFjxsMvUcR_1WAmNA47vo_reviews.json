Then we moved on to ordering food. We ordered the Schnitzel with Frankfurt Green Sauce and potatoes. We also ordered the Pork rib cooked with sauerkraut and potatoes.  The pork rib had really nice flavor as well as the sauerkraut. Still thinking about it! Overall the food was solid, the employees were attentive and it was a nice experience.",

The apple wine was just fair as I have tried much better ones in other restaurant. I wonder why it still got >4 stars in the overall rating. Would not recommend others to visit this restaurant.",

It is better to show up early to avoid queuing.",
