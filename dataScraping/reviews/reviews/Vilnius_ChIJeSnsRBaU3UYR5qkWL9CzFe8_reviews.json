Service was a little slow but otherwise fine.\nFood was reasonable but not the best I've had in Vilnius. Reasonable drinks prices and selection.",

You'll feel like you're being served by robots here. Maximum professional, but not a bit of smile, nothing like that.\nWe waited 45 minutes for our food, which I thought was very long.\nAnyway, the environment is amazing. It's beautiful in the garden and inside. The food and the wine were excellent.\nI take a star off for the long wait and no smile.\nI would still recommend the restaurant. Worth a visit.",
