Personal from reception tried to help me and gave a kettle. Hotel is positioned like pet friendly but price for my small baby was too high. Breakfast is ok: not tasty but you can find something just not be hungry . Coffee is terrible. There is reconstruction front of hotel and too noisy.",

The room is so small that they did not even install normal air conditioners! THERE IS JUST A FAN!! I gave 2 stars because it is located near a beautiful park, there is McDonalds and good food. But for $ 50 I would choose Ibis.",

There is an odd smell everywhere. Very small shower with a busted showerhead. Reminds me of staying in a hostel. The walls are very thin, you can hear neighboring guests, anyone in the hallways, and even people on the street (I was on the 3rd floor). Breakfast is free but is far from the best hotel breakfast I've had in the Baltics.\n\nYou get what you pay for. One of the cheaper hotels in the area. Just know the trade-offs.",

However, the rooms are below minimal for amenities:  no refrigerator, no USB outlets, very, very few wall power outlets - none where you need them, one poor quality pillow each, no air conditioning, couldn't drink the water and they wouldn't provide any for brushing teeth, bathroom fixtures from the stone ages.  I will not stay here again.",
