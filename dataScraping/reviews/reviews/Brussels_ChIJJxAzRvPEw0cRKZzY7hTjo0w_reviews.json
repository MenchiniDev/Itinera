Very comfy beds available and with breakfast (that is not included when it should instead at these prices….) that is really good. No reception during night time but code system make things easier.",

The atmosphere was cozy and intimate, with a warm and inviting decor.\n\nBut the real star of the show was the food! We started with the fresh Prawns, which were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. And the Sole Fish, their specialty, was truly exceptional - fresh, tender, and utterly delicious.\n\nBut the pièce de résistance was the dessert - the local Vanilla Ice Cream with Hot Belgian Chocolate. It was love at first bite! The combination was heavenly, and we couldn't get enough.\n\nOverall, Odette En Ville is a must-visit in Brussels. The service was top-notch, the food was incredible, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. Don't miss out on this amazing dining experience!\n\nHighly recommend the Prawns, Sole Fish, and the Vanilla Ice Cream with Hot Belgian Chocolate. You won't regret it!",
