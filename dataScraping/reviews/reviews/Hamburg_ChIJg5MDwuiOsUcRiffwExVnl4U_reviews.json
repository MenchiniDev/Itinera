            "text": "It was an overall clean room but with fairly basic furniture. Very good for a short trip. A good point was the separate toilet and shower rooms but due to that, space in the shower room was quite limited and maybe not completely comfortable. It serves its function of a comfortable bed and stay but it is not exactly a fashionable/modern place to stay.",

There is a street about a 7- minute walk away called Lange Reihe (Long Road) that has excellent restaurants and bars on it.  There is a metro station just 1.5 blocks away, a grocery store, and 3 bakeries...  We loved the local bar that is in the hotel. Great bartenders and great cocktails.\n\nThe room was comfortable and this hotel is a good value. However, the shower is TINY and is probably 5 square feet.  There is NO air conditioning in this hotel and during our stay, there was a heat wave in Hamburg (low 90's) and it was miserable trying to sleep.  The beds are okay...not hard, not soft, but not just right either...there was no view, but not that it mattered...",

Nice selection of tea powders\n4. Friendly staff. Quick check-in and check out\n5. WiFi was fast enough. But could be improved\n6. Spacious rooms\n7. Spa\n\nThere was nothing to complain about. I would visit again.",
