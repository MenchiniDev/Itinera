The room was spacious and clean, the bed was very comfortable. The shower is indeed on the small side. It has a curved glass door. The trick is to stand with the back to that door, and suddenly the shower is comfortable ans spacious enough :-)\n\nThe restaurant has a good selection of very tasty local dishes.\n\nI can recommend Devin Hotel and will certainly pick it again on my next visit to Bratislava!",

Really good convenient location… really nice sunset views also.\n\nBreakfast was nice with a good choice, the hotel was clean and spacious. Staff very friendly.\n\nThe only complaint we had was that I booked via hotels.com and it’s listed as having full access to the gym. However to us the gym for 1 day (and the gym is a basic dated gym) is €15!!! Extortionate and I may have chosen a different hotel if I was made aware previously.",

Then I did see one or two others at breakfast. It is like a deserted ghost town. The room is nice, a touch noisy from the road. Shower is very small, to the point where it is cramped. Breakfast is OK.",
