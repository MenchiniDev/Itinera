            "text": "A little bit more lighting would help because this place was kind of dark, and I wasn't even in one of their little nooks. Mirsad, the server, was super friendly and happy to practice speaking English and Bosnian with me and my group. Prices for Sarajevo I would say are a little high, but if you want a place that's outside of Bascarsija and a little secluded, you will find peace of mind with really good food. I saw some pizzas that looked nice. I did their house special, the snicl (schnitzel) and it was more than enough food at good value. The whole meal including a drink and a glass of wine was 30KM.",

The dough is instant frozen type that can be made in the microwave. the other dishes are of medium quality and The arrangement of the pizza is visually unpleasant and I am disappointed!\n\nI really don't understand why the price of pizza is 18 bam /\n\nI think that such a price is unfounded if we consider the ingredients, the taste, the service ~",

Two of us ordered the Sea Bass with a salad the other ordered Chicken Kabobs.  I also ordered the homemade apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  It was like Baklava with apples in the middle.... Really good.  The prices were very reasonable.  I highly recommend Galija.",
