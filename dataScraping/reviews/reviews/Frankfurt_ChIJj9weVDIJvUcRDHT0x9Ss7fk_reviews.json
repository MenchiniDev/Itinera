I was allowed to pay an additional €176 or cancel free of charge. I decided to do none since their price was not a mistake, they just felt they could charge double due to the event taking place in the Messe.\n\nWithout agreement they cancelled my booking for me. I'm not even sure that's legal as their regular price wasn't a mistake (for other weekends they charge the same), but since I got better things to do in life they know they'll get away with these ludicrous business practices.",
