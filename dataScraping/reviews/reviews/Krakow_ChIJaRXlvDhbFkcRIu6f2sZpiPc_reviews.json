The staff is friendly and service-minded. The breakfast is good and varies from day to day. The distance to the city is also convenient, just a 20-minute walk to reach the center.",

Some dusting is needed. We wanted a movie night, but it was not possible to watch anything in English or cast from our phones (no smart TV).\n\nThe common areas were OK. Colourful, but neither cosy or hip atmosphere. Cramped. Beautiful Christmas though.\n\nI would have rated the hotel 3 if not for the amazing service and spa treatments",

It was possible to store our bikes in the underground parking lot wich was only closed during the night. As you understand we didn’t put our 5000 EUR bike at this open place. According to the website the hotel should be “bike friendly”\n\nBecause of this we stored our bikes in the hotel room.\n\nFor the rest the hotel is fine but a little bit outdated. Breakfast is fine but the room has no athmosfere at all.",
