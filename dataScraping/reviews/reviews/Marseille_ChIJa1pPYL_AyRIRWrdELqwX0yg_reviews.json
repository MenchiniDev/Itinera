            "text": "We booked lunch at Le Miramar based on a recommendation. The restaurant is in a great location overlooking the port and thereâ€™s a traditional feel as you walk in the restaurant. We ordered the Bouillabaisse, again this was based on a recommendation. The first course of soup was richly flavoured, however in our opinion the second course with the fish parts wasnâ€™t good, so we were naturally disappointed. We also had a few tasting morsels of bread with salmon mousse and mussels in tomato sauce which were distinctly average. The customer service is very good though, very welcoming, polite and attentive.",

Everything in this restaurant fantastic, tasty food & delicious, friendly staff & helpful, but they were little bit slowly in serving. But literally the food amazing even the appetizer it was very good of choices, the price very expensive for two persons.",

Unfortunately, the taste is not included. The flavors and recipes are weird. Literally, you expect so much for the price and the way it served. And the bread here is really bad. Not acceptable. Mussels (starter) actually were very tasty. But pasta with lobster and staffed fish ... well. I would not recommend to order it.",
