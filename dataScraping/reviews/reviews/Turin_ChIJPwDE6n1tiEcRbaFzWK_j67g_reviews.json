The balcony from our room was spacious and included a large couch, table and view of the street below. The steam shower was an extra bonus that was not expected. The staff was helpful and friendlier than you could ever expect. The restaurant offers a fantastic menu and wine selection while not being too expensive. We would go back here in a heartbeat.",

            "text": "Short version: The staff tried to sneak an extra bottle of wine on the bill. When confronted, they reluctantly removed it off the bill, no apologies.\n\nHad the tasting menu. Some interesting dishes, but nothing amazing taste-wise. For the main course, the beef was good, but the accompanying potatoes were bland and dry. The mousse desert was particularly disappointing - high in sugar with an unpleasant texture.\n\nWhen we pointed out we were charged an extra bottle of wine, the staff refused to take us seriously until we showed them the bill. Ended up being charged 3 times for the dinner due to issues with their POS. We had to leave my card details with them, as payment would not go through. Despite agreeing they'd wait for the previous payment to settle, the staff used the card details to make a payment as soon as we left the restaurant (my Revolut app has instant payment notifications).\n\nSo mediocre food for the price and dishonest staff who try to get away with theft.",

However:\n1. it was freezingly called in our room and turning the A/C unit to heat was making the air really unfresh, while not completely heating the room.\n2. the shower was taking ages to get warm and it was leaking on the floor.\n3. at the breakfast there was only one salt shaker available for all 10 tables and the service vehemently protested when we took it for a few minutes to our table.",
