It tasted of nothing and it felt like quickly made pasta sauce, and the pasta itself felt like standard supermarket quality. The pizza was also really bad, no flavor, poor texture.\nDelivery took around 40min longer than stated.\nAll around really bad experience. It was the 3rd time ordering from them, but this was definitely the last time.",
