Hotel position was amazing, we went pretty much everywhere just walking with the stroller and the public transportation was incredibly close as well.\nWe used the room service few times too and it was very good, you can place orders using your room tablet which is easy and fast and then you receive a call to confirm the order. Food quality was premium and not too pricey.\nHotel staff was spot on, kind, professional and always ready to help.\nOh, and the breakfast. You must try the breakfast. Like, really, you have to. Amazing.",

            "text": "Really nice place for the price, with great service and accommodating staff. The spa and fitness facilities available on weekdays were a nice bonus. However, if you get a room with an extra bed, be aware that it's quite firm (and that's coming from someone who weighs 80kg). The only thing I would suggest to the hotel is to either lower the price of breakfast or include it in the room rate, so guests don't feel like they're paying extra for it each morning. Overall, a great experience!",

The restaurant on site boasts an awesome breakfast buffet w/everything one could imagine. It also serves lunch/dinner. I will definitely return to this hotel whenever I travel back to Hamburg, Germany!",
