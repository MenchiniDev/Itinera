            "text": "With its very peculiar decoration at its entrance this place captured my attention. As it was literally next door to the hotel I chose for my staying in Vilnius it was an easy choice when it came to choose where to go for a late lunch.\n\nI was delighted to see the care for the decor continued inside.\n\nTheir menu is very extensive and can accommodate a bit every taste.\n\nI was keen to try the pancakes with potatoes and I'm glad I did. Lovely texture, nice heartwarming savory snack.\n\nEverything was nice and I'm sure it would have been lovely to see the place with more customers if only I had gone in a different time of the day.\n\nI found I had to wait a surprisingly long time for my pancackes. It may have been necessary for the recipe but I was not ready for that.",

            "text": "Great place with a really cool atmosphere. Alice in Wonderland atmosphere with pancakes. The best thing is the organization. QR code with a menu with good descriptions and photos that allows you to pay for your order right away and after a few moments the waiter brings the order to the table (even though the staff warned that it was busy and you had to wait a long time, the order was ready in less than 30 minutes). Great thing! The food was delicious and you can see how it is prepared, 10/10!",

All of our food was good and the staff were friendly and helpful although there was a misunderstanding about one of the orders. But they tried to make it right. I would go here again. I noticed lots of youngsters here but think adults would like it too. You can watch them make the crepes which always entertains me. I would go here again and recommend it to others.",
