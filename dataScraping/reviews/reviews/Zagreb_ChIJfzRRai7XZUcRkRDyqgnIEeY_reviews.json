We repeatedly told them nothing too big but….. it was enough for 5 people.  Food was very good and ambience was lovely.   Be advised there is no printed wine or food menu and no prices.\n\nThey saw Americans coming and literally took advantage of us.  Very disappointing!!!",

There is no menu but he explained all the dinner options clearly.\nWe had tomato soup, cured sea bass and charcuterie to start. Followed by fish stew, mussels and pasta and grilled lamb. Pistachio & raspberry tiramisu and fig Panna cotta for dessert. Lovely food and wine. A very memorable and enjoyable evening",
