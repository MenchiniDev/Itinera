            "text": "The food was really good. I'm not a steak person and when I do eat it I like it well done, but I never usually get it well done. The tenderloin was cooked perfectly and I appreciate that a lot. All 5 of our meals were very good. The prices seemed high but I don't think it was unusual for the area. The service was good and the eating area was spacious and nice. Definitely recommend if you are in the area. We got the beef tenderloin, salmon soup, Caeser salad, way you want 2, and the way you want 4 pizza.",

It needs more mushrooms and the truffle oil didn't even taste.\nThe reindeer stew was tasty yet the meat was dry and different from what a stew would be.\nThe wine selection is very good but wished the wine was poured at the table to appreciate the bottle.üç∑\nThe waiter was present and did a great job.\nüÜóüëç",

            "text": "It's strongly recommended.\nThe restaurant atmosphere is excellent. The people working there are really nice, and always give good hints to order a food. I ordered moose stew and my friend ordered whitefish. Both meals were delicious. The moose was so soft and well cooked. It was served with mashed potatoes, pickle cucumbers and red berries. Pickle was not really matched with the rest but that was alright. I also ordered a glass of red wine (botta valpolicella ripasso) proposed by them which was quite good and matched with my food.",
