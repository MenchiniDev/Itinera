I'm assuming that's because they want you to pay for the upgrade. I didn't, so I can't comment on its capabilities.\nAll the staff were very friendly, pleasant, and helpful.\nThere was plenty of available parking, and it was easy to access.\nIt's a good place if you need a bed.",

He is an absolute credit to your team.",

The bath was fabulous and a good size.\nWe have always found the beds to be very comfortable and this was no exception.\nWe had the cooked breakfast option which includes continental and it was all enjoyable.\nAll staff here were very helpful and cheerful. Special shout out to Racheal (I think!) who served our breakfast with a joke and a smile - thank you!",

Coke was Tony and over priced for a bottle.\nMenus is so limited a 5 year old could cook as many different dishes as what there is to select.\nChef late not here till after 1730.  Absolutely shocking has let the hotel down.",
