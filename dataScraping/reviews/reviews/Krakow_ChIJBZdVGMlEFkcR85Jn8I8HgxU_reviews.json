The room is big enough, but the sheets were smelling bad and also the pillow was very bad.  We wanted to have a drink at their bar, but nobody served us, even though we were still on time..and the people who work there could hear us..",

Public transport is available from hotel to town so convenient. Rooms are massive, cozy and immaculate. Highly rated and recommended. The room that we got was disabled friendly so bathing area was slightly lower for average height person and gets a bit slippery however not inconvenient as such. It's also very kids friendly. We got a bargain deal including breakfast so I'd say it was pretty much everything we wanted. I'd recommend this place.",
