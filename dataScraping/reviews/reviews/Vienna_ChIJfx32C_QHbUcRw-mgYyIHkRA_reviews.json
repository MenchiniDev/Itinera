            "text": "Very good and clean hotel. If there is a rating of 4.8 i would have give it that. the reason why i give it less than 5 is the shower inside the room. It’s made of glass and visible from every where in the room. some of the rooms have curtain but not all of them do. I think this is the only thing i don’t like about it. this could be OK for a couple, but not with kids and not for siblings. Manors matter, if you agree.\nThe breakfast buffet is good, the best part of it is the fresh orange juice. There are good options to pick from and eat. The breakfast is open from 6 to 10 am.\nThe staff is great with wonderful attitude.\nYou can get better prices of the hotel through booking.com, priceline.com or the hotel website especially if you pay in advance and take it as non refundable.",

            "text": "We enjoyed the hotel room.  The shower in the middle of the room seemed weird, but caused us no problems. The price was higher than we wanted to spend, but has difficulty finding other accommodations.  Once we arrived and found out Taylor Swift was supposed to be doing concerts on our dates, maybe that was why the price was so high.  The hotel is not a high-end hotel, so the price was the only drawback.",

            "text": "Liked the idea of a glass shower room in the bedroom and a separate toilet room. Clean, spacious room. Blanket somewhat small (maybe better if 1.5 person size?). Ok breakfast and dinner buffets. Bar staff are nice. Reception staff very slow, only 1 taking care when checking in and checkout. Morning noise guaranteed to wake you up even from 3rd floor (at least).",

There wasn't a minibar in my room, so keep that in mind, but there is a well stocked minibar by the reception which is staffed 24/7. I also liked the hotel bar the bartender was friendly and professional. He can do basically any cocktail.\nI do recommend!",
