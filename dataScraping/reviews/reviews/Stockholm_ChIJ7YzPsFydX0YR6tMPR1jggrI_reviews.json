The facilities like gym and sauna were very good and clean. Decent selection for breakfast.\n\nSituated in a good location and everything was within walking distance. I would recommend it and I would stay here again.",

The staff was so sweet and helpful, our room was very comfortable with a gorgeous view of the nearby park, and the breakfast was probably one of the best hotel breakfasts I’ve had! We were with a baby and felt really looked after by the sweet staff. The location was also incredible, central, walking distance from old town, museums, parks etc. Can’t wait to come back!",

We couldn't unpack when we got home and had to wash and freeze stuff to make sure we didn't bring it into the house. All in all, i wouldn't stay there again.",

The sheets where also in bad condition, one blanket cover had a clearly visible hole. You get only one middle sized towel in the room.\n- Upon check-in I agreed to have my room cleaned every other day, as they want to be \"green\". However I didnt get any cleaning services or fresh towels until I requested it to be done at the reception on day 3! Then housekeeping defaulted back to every day.\n- House keeping staff was taking breaks sitting on the floor of the hallway.\n-You have to book a 30 min breakfast slot the day before. Not ideal when you want to sleep in and enjoy a relaxed breakfast!\n\n+ The location is good, you can walk almost everywhere or take the Metro not to far away.\n+Nice staff at the reception and breakfast service.",
