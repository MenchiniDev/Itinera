            "text": "Hands down one of THE BEST places to eat out in Bucharest. Their staff are amazing, super accommodating and helpful - definitely one of the better services to be found in the city.\n\nThe food is absolutely amazing, from entrées to desserts, and their portions are HUGE. For reference, a schnitzel is no less than 750 grams - that’s almost a kilo’s worth! And so tasty and flavourful, absolutely loved it!\nAlso, their menu is quite large, so there is a lot of variety, which means you are definitely going to find something you’ll like.\nPrices are pretty fair, and on the friendlier end when it comes to popular Bucharest restaurants.\n\nWould definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get a great meal and great service for a really good price! All in all, an amazing experience.",

The garden outside is the nicest place to sit - inside has high stools which have to be perched on.  AND they serve food till after midnight - brilliant.",
