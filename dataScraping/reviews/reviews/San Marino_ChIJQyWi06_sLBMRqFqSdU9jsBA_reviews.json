            "text": "I walked past this place and decided to visit for lunch. I peered into the restaurant and it was completely empty during busy lunchtime where other restaurants were so busy. I asked for table for 1 and then this young female staff asked me to come in and sit. Just as I was about to sit, another female staff came out and told me \"no tables- full\". So hard to believe the restaurant was \"full\" looking at the emptiness inside.\nThen she changed and said \"inside only for more than 4 people\" and said I could sit outside if I wanted to dine.\nI said \"okay\" reluctantly and then I started to order the food. While the food was being prepared, suddenly the wind got stronger and I felt cold. So the food was served and then I started eating. Within a while I felt the chills and I asked if I could shift inside and the answer I got was a firm \"NO\".\nAs I was eating the Piadina, the winds got stronger and my food starting flying around. A quarter of the flatbread flew under the opposite table and vegetables also flew to other chairs. I was so frustrated that I decided to leave without finishing the food.\nAnd as I went into the restaurant to make payment, it was not even a quarter full, and I saw 2 groups of pairs sitting inside.\nSo unhappy that the food didn't taste nice and I had to endure this kind of treatment from the staff.\nBad experience and wouldn't recommend this place. I would give an even lower score if I could.",
