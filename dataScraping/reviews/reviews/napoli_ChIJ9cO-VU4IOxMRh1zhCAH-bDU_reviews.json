My wife had the three different types of meatballs which she also enjoyed, and I enjoyed a bit too ðŸ˜Š.\nWe were the only ones in the restaurant, so the ambience was....however the restaurant is quite quaint and bistro like.\nA little further out of the tourist zone perhaps? But authentic local food offered as well as classic comfort food.\nHigher prices than competitors though...",

It was a very good accident.\n\nThe price for the food was very affordable, especially considering it was probably the best food we'd had in Naples.\n\nThe pizzas and pasta were fantastic as was the house wine and the local Lucrezia beer.\n\nThe only minor downside was the two waiters having to go upstairs to get the food which meant they couldn't be as attentive or available to their guests which was a shame because they were friendly, courteous and met every request.",

We got the pizzas and an appetizer.  It just seems there is an edginess from Italians.  Wherever we go we get the feeling of not being welcomed, not sure if itâ€™s a cultural thing or not.  But, this is a cool restaurant with a pizza oven right inside where all the pizzas are made.  Pretty cool and worth the price.",
