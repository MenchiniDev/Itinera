Our order was wrong, and they didn't even apologize! They just said, \"Just take it, please.\" Like, what??\n\nThey also don't accept card payments. The food is very bland and tasteless. Don't bother yourself to come here.",

When I got the sandwich it had cheese in it, I asked nicely please I ordered without cheese, the guy works in the kitchen came out and told me we canâ€™t change or give you money back go give it to someone else. Very rode. The guy was bold, with beard and tattoos in the arm. Very unprofessional\nAfter spending my credit on calling to get some help, finally after all they made me the sandwich , however the guy working in the kitchen is very unfair and rude, I will never go back again.",

(Scc chicken risotto soup Montana)\n\nTaste is acceptable but itâ€™s very funny to sell something like this.\nThey should change the name of the plate not chicken but smashed potatoes. So you got some side dishes like chicken pcs.",

Water is being paid everywhere in Europe, and I don't see big deal to pay 0.25 euro cents for half a liter bottle. Some people that are complaining here are insane  to say the least.\n\nManager or owner is uncultured swine and I whole heatedly agree that shouting at his workers is beyond words. He also tried to evade taxes even tho he had one of the biggest profits in year.",
