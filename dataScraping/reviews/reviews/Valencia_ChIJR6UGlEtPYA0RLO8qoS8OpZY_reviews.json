Ordered the ham/cheese coquette - these were rather oily even though the filling inside was sufficient and creamy, very coying because of the amount of oil.\n\nThey are famous for their paella, however I found the rice undercooked (you can see the white bits in the middle) and extremely salty. At 24 euros per serving, would probably find better elsewhere. On the positive, the seafood was plentiful and fresh. Naturally sweet and tasty.",

The mussels were in season and melted in your mouth along with the squid paella which was perfection, tender and delicious. Also can we talk about the sangria?! I mean I didn’t go for the sangria but I’m so glad I ordered it! Women owned business that was phenomenal. Reserve it, go, and enjoy the smartest decision you’ll make!",

Grilled squid and Valencian tomato salad were gorgeous. The vegetable paella was so yummy. Only problem was we had no room for dessert! Arrive hungry. I hope to return next time I'm in Valencia.",
