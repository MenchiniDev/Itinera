Slightly off the main square in Skopje down a corridor is this pretty open air garden restaurant with great food and service. The traditional bread with garlic and cheese was the star of the show for me but the bacon wrapped rolled burger stuffed with cheese and ham was also excellent (although I was as stuffed as the burger by the end). The chips were a little cold but otherwise an excellent meal for a very reasonable price.",
