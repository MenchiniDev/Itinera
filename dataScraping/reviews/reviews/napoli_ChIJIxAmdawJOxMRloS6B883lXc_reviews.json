Our 1st taste of pizza in Naples & we weren‚Äôt disappointed, we opted for the Quattro formaggi, Margherita & one with sausage & cream. All of them were literally amazing - a great intro to our Napoli pizza tour",

            "text": "This spot was recommended by one of the locals. Definitely in the top 3 worst experiences here in Italy. Service was terribly slow despite not being super busy and the food took forever to come out. We knew what we wanted pretty quick but still took almost an hour for food to hit the table. we were stuck there for almost 2.5 hours. The food was bland and not good. Tasted terrible. I tried to explain to our server that the fried pizza should contain red sauce and he said it did, but I opened it up and showed him that there was MAYBE a teaspoon worth of sauce in it. It was also about 65% tough, flavorless dough. Our server said it's traditionally served with a small amount of sauce on the inside, but this was so little it was negligible at best. He got offended when I asked for some sauce on the side to add to it and told me the dish should not be altered. I disagreed after trying it. at least I tried it before asking for more sauce ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThe pasta was also pretty bad. The bread in the brown bag was old, stale nasty bread.\n\nThere were 2 other tables around us that also had similar complaints about bad food. Both of those tables got similar responses to us. The restaurant doesn't take responsibility for bad food. It was apparently those guests fault the food was bad lol.\n\nTerrible restaurant. We do not recommend",

The mussels were some of the most fresh that I have ever had. The only thing I did not like about this place was the server kept mentioning that we tip him throughout the entire time. I don‚Äôt like when people ask for tips, so it was annoying during the experience.",
