Most of all of you get to meet beryl on reception count yourself lucky. She is a real credit to the hotel... Just wish we could afford to come back again......",

The hotel staff has been nothing but helpful and friendly, from the reception, to the concierge, to the bar tender and everyone in between. Plus getting to play with the two resident cats is a treat on its own. We will definitely be back next time we come to Paris. Their breakfast buffet and amenities are also top notch.",

The French windows, pillow menu, wonderful aroma throughout the hotel, delicious chips, and endless treats made our experience unforgettable. We had an incredible stay at Castille and would definitely come back. Highly recommend it if youâ€™re visiting Paris!",

Despite advertising 24 hour room service, that was not the case, no hair conditioner in the room until my 2nd day, very basic mini bar and cold coffee being served at breakfast were some examples of where this hotel fell short of 5 stars to me. All that said, nice staff, good sized rooms and great location.",
