We love ordering soup on cold days, and for sharing, the fried rice rolls or the cauliflower and gyoza are fantastic. As for main dishes, any curry version is delicious. If you want something fresher, I recommend the mango salad. And let's not even talk about the desserts... the tapioca dessert is amazing. Highly recommended for going with friends, a partner, and also with children. The drinks are also really tasty.",

We have already come across more successful Vietnamese restaurants in Barcelona and it is a shame that the flavors in this place are not strong enough to make us want to go back there. The gluten-free advertising was also not one of the best we've come across at a level where we weren't sure if what we were being told was really so and we can be calm",
