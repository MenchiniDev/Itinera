            "text": "Tasty Indian food. Highly recommend this place if you want delicious indian food. Just a feedback but the butter chicken should have boned pieces and not boneless pieces. I wish the biryani did not take 45 mins or else I would have ordered it. The owner is a friendly man who is usually around. There’s a shop at the restaurant too and proceeds from it go to a foundation in Assam, India. Truly lovely place. Simple but traditional interiors and a must visit for those who want Indian food in Liechtenstein. Side note- the naan bread and the mango lassi for 10/10",
