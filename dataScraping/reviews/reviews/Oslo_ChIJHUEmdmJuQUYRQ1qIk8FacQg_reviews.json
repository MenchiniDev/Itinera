            "text": "The good : Nice atmosphere, good service , good beer and good pizza in a good portion. Not the best pizza I have had, but quite nice.\nThe bad : I ordered the alle vongole pasta that very clearly says that has vongole shells . I hope the restaurant isn't doing this on purpose but I did not get vongole. I got cockles ( hjerteskjell) . And since there is no cockles pasta I am assuming they are passing the cockles for vongole. Not cool. Cockles are cheeper to buy and much much smaller than vongole, plus for the people that know, they do taste differently as well. You wouldn't want to order cod and get pollock right? The pasta itself was also not good at all. It felt like it was precooked a few days ago and just warmed slightly when served. Also such small quantity of pasta. The flavour was there which is good though, but again cockles flavour not vongole. I am ok with eating cockles pasta but then I dont want to pay for vongole and get cockles. For a restaurant that is supposed to be authentic italian food, this was very disappointing.\nConclusion : Just skip the pasta and get pizza instead.",
