Shower or even whole bedroom looks recently new.\nBreakfast is super! 12.50, but unlimited everything, no need for lunch.\n\n20 minutes walk from the cathedral, but via a nice shopping area or along the river rine. So good routes. Would do again for sure!",

The rooms are pretty spacious and seem to be recently painted. The air conditioner was also working fine and the Wifi connectivity was decent. Room was clean. The floor carpet and sofa and chairs were old and worn out, but hopefully the hotel will replace them soon. We didn't have breakfast.",
