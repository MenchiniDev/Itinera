The service was really quick and efficient! The service team was obviously very busy. I know there were negative reviews about bad service, but I definitely didn’t experience it. The service team found a table for two of us very quickly and were all very nice and friendly! The foods were very delicious, and the beer was excellent! The interior design was very traditional German brewery style. Ver Nice experience!",

They got my main wrong and forgot my dessert but they   were constantly on the go so not that bothered. The staff were very friendly and easygoing. As someone who doesn't really like lager, their classic lager was a lighter and enjoyable one. It was a great vibe, would absolutely go again",

Traditional Bavarian food and great beer makes for a memorable night out.  The staff are good fun and always available to serve you.  Highly recommended!!",
