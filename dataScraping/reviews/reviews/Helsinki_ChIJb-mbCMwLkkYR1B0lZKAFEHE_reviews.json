Breakfast buffet was better than average which included omelette for your liking.\n\nRestaurant staff also quick and helpful.\n\nLocation is just perfect!",

Coffee, tea and service are great.\nEven with the best efforts, the rooms retain a smell from aged materials, as one would expect from a historic hotel. But something to be aware of for those with sensitive noses.\nThe showers are quite small but the rest of the bathrooms is spacious.",

So comfy I considered taking it home. The bathroom was bigger than my first apartment!\nBreakfast was a royal feast—I lost count of my trips to the buffet. The coffee alone is worth a stay. I even tried the sauna and came out feeling like a new person—relaxed and refreshed.\n\nHotel Kämp made me feel like royalty. If you want to be pampered and indulge in luxury, this is your spot. Just don’t blame me if you never want to leave!",
