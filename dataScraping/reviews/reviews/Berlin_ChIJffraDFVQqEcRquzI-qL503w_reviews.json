Price definitely reasonable. Rooms are super clean! I will definitely make this my #1 choice to stay while in Berlin. Accommodated my family very well. SUPER quiet rooms. The restaurant in the hotel and breakfast was addicting! Thanks so much for a great weekend.",

Wonderful, very nicely appointed rooms, warm and attentive staff and of course everything is spotlessly clean and shiny. Did I mention the great location? Nothing to improve here.  I very much enjoyed my third stay here and I will be back.",

He was able to help us with all our unique needs.  Melanie Skuras at the front desk was delightful and also very helpful in hours that Dan was not available.  The facility and location were very nice, but for me the people made the difference.",

The suite that we were upgraded to was absolutely beautiful and featured more space and utility than any other hotel I have stayed at. The staff too are attentive and efficient while being friendly and suggestive to guests who are new to Berlin. 5/5 highly recommended to both business travelers and couples and families alike.",
