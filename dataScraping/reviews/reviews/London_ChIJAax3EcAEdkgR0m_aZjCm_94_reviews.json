A very nice bar.\nThe hotel is set back off the main roads but a 2 minute walk to the Thames and then a 10 minute walk to Waterloo underground station, Big Ben, London eye and everything else around there.\nThere is a car park if you drive.\nThere are other underground stations near but the closest is 10 minutes walk.\nThe rooms are very nice, clean and a good size.\nPrice wise, it is a good price. I'd recommend getting breakfast as you have a great choice of food from continental to full English breakfast.",

Friendly and helpful staff, clean comfortable rooms (had a view overlooking the palace across the road and with Big Ben in the background) and, also has it's own car park which is a rarety in town. The room service breakfast is ginormous but, on the just warm side for the cooked element. Would be very happy to return if back in the area.",
