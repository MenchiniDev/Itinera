But there is a circulation of shows every 30 minutes and the performers will go outside to ask for a tip at the end. You can also have a photo taken.\n\nOrdering food only has I think a 20 minute window so I suggest eating out and just grab your jerez or cerveza here while watching a show.\n\nIt’s not allowed to take videos as well.",

It works like this: you order a drink and only then you can take a sit freely to one of the table; then you can take from the kitchen area one of they simple tapas. Suggested for an aperitivo with Friends!",

You just need to buy a drink (per person) and leave some tips :) they say cash only but have a credit card machine if you really need it, which I preferred. I attended flamenco theatre but found this show to be so spellbinding as well. The dancer is full of passion and you can see it in her moves and expressions. Highly recommend! Phone should be put away during the performance.",

Is looking like an old taverna but I think doesn't matter when the atmosphere is so great! We went 2 nights in the row!! Please add card payment, first night we left in the middle of show because we didn't had cash to spend anymore....",
