            "text": "I had a great time at Pepsi Center Riga with my friends last weekend. We decided to go there because we wanted to have some fun and try different activities. We were not disappointed. Pepsi Center Riga has something for everyone, from bowling and billiards to squash and tennis. We played a few games of bowling and pool, and then we tried squash for the first time. It was a lot of fun and a good workout. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and they gave us some tips on how to play better. The equipment was in good condition and the lanes and courts were clean and spacious. We also enjoyed the food and drinks at the bar/restaurant. They had a good selection of dishes and beverages, and the service was fast and efficient. The prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity of food and drinks. The atmosphere was lively and cheerful, and we felt very welcome and comfortable. We had a blast and we will definitely come back again. Pepsi Center Riga is a perfect place to have a good time with friends or family. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a place to enjoy themselves in Riga.",
