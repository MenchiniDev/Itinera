            "text": "The hotel has potential but falls short in some areas. While the breakfast was excellent, the beds were comfortable, and it was nice to be able to let fresh air in, the overall experience was let down by a few issues. The towels were old, the toilet seat was broken, and despite requesting a bathrobe, it never arrived. Additionally, there were stains on the carpet and a half-empty bottle of Pepsi left in the fridge from a previous guest, suggesting a lack of attention to cleanliness. With improvements in maintenance and housekeeping, it could be a much better stay.",

            "text": "I recently stayed at what I believe is one of the best Radisson hotels in Eastern Europe. While the exterior might not be the most modern or flashy, the rooms inside are top-notch. The bed was large and comfortable, and the renovations are done with great attention to quality. Everything you need is there.\n\nBut the real standout? The breakfast. It's honestly one of the best I've ever had in a hotelâ€”great quality and a huge variety of dishes. As a Radisson Club premium member, I was given a room on the top floor, late checkout until 2 PM, and a lovely surprise box in my room with snacks, a Coke, and a handwritten note from the guest manager. It was such a thoughtful touch. Five stars across the board from me!",
