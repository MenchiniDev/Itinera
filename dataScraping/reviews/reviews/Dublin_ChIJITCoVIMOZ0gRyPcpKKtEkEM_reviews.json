            "text": "We stayed in the apartments on the roof. Amazing views of Dublin, and not too loud for being right in temple bar. Loved the patios both of our apartments had. The only possibly bad part, was that to get back to the stairwell from the apartment you needed a key card. To get into the apartment you needed a key card. So if you accidentally leave your apartment without your key card, you are stuck on the roof. Additionally, while we were there, our key cards to our apartment suddenly stopped working, so we found ourselves in the situation of being stuck on the roof. Thankfully, I had a spare key card for our friends apartment next door that still worked, so I was able to use that to get back to the stairs and down to the lobby, where they were able to make new key cards for us easily. If I were them, I would recommend changing that door setup somehow to prevent a situation like that. Other than that hiccup, absolutely incredible value and place to stay.",

            "text": "The most amazing Pub we saw in Dublin. Very central location near the first Temple Bar. There was traditional Irish music, everyone was singing along and dancing, and it was packed to the rim. We were unable to find a table to eat, so I cannot speak about the food, but it was fun to just walk in, maybe sit at the bar, and listen to the music. I will most definitely be back, perhaps earlier to be able to sit and enjoy the food.",
