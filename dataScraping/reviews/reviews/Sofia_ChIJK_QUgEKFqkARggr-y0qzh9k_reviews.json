All the staff understand English and are very professional in communication. Had a nice spread of breakfast. For a vegetarian there were a lot of options to choose from. Located at a convenient location not very far from Serdika station and city centre. I would highly recommend this hotel.",

Cleaners do the best they can with what they are working with. Complimentary toiletries good. Tea coffee in room, get milk from breakfast room\nBreakfast ok but we paid €16 for two at the end of breakfast.\nEasy walk to metro, straight from airport and back. Easy walk to centre, if you don’t mind walking 30mins. Trams are super noisy and many , going across a broken crossroads so you can’t open the window (I did try ignoring them! )",

There are some really good people working in this spot and I’m so grateful to have had such a great time in this hotel. Rooms were clean, beds were comfy, breakfast was nice (drank too much coffee maybe that’s why I left my passport there :D) and the staff went above and beyond to help me check for allergens in the breakfast items.",
