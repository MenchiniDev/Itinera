            "text": "The food was incredible, and the price of ~17€/person is not bad either. I admit I was somewhat apprehensive due to the review further down the page that said that 5 courses weren’t enough and the food was not good, but I wholeheartedly disagree. I found that the five items I ordered were not only TOO MUCH food, but were also beautifully presented and carried a flavor to match their appearances. What you “lose” in not getting all you can eat is more than made up for in the quality of the dishes. The salmon, for example, just melted in my mouth. I highly recommend this restaurant and will return if ever again I find myself in San Marino.",

Left a very untrustworthy feeling. Hope I'm wrong here, but don't want anyone getting scammed.",
