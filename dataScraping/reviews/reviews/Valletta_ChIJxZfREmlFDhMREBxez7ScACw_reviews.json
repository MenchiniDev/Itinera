Clean well decorated and furnished restaurant.\nWould highly recommend.\nTwo seniors from Cheshire UK",

They always had a smile and just made you feel comfortable. And fortunately for us, the food matched their personality, amazing. We got a curry and tikka dish that was really good. The Nan of course was out of this world and the appetizer went perfect with the whole meal. Definitely 5 stars all around.",
