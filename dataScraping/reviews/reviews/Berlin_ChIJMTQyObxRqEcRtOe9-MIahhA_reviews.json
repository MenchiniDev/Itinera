Customer service was poor - from booking to check-in, to issue reporting, we had to repeat our requests a few times to make sure that they were taken care of. I felt that the money paid to the room did not worth it.\nUntil the quality of customer service is improved, I would not recommend my friends or relatives to this hotel.",

Staff at the reception kept repeating some specific words in German, and he even is not aware of that, which makes the guests who speaks English felt very confused. Free bottle of water for only one night (or is this a culture in Germany? Why?).\n\nAll in all, if the price is good, book here, if you want it to be delightful, I don't really think so. They (yes, several of them) sound pretty arrogant and don't want to spend one more minute with you.",

She is so nice and accommodating, she recommended a wonderful gin to me, and I loved talking to her. Thank you, Miranda! The front desk staff is also great and very helpful.\n\nBerlin was very warm, and the room was very warm. It ostensibly had air conditioning, but the room remained uncomfortably warm. We asked for and were given a fan, and when we put it in front of the open window overnight, it was okay, but then there were lots of bugs in the room.\n\nThe lobby and outside furniture are comfortable for hanging out, and I met other guests who were fun to talk to. We would probably stay here again, especially when the weather is cooler.",
