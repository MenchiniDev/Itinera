Yet, rooms are comfortable and with new facilities. Room service is excellent!!! Stuff is polite and at service as well. I recommend at least one meal in the Berlin restaurant just next door. Garden is great and comfy. Breakfast, decent! Liked the sweets. Coffee is a real one at breakfast.",

It is very clean and my room was modern and staffed with all necessities. Above all to mention the friendliness of the staff that were all times approachable and helpful.\nThe breakfast has a wide variety of local and international foods.\nGreat place, I would come again!",
