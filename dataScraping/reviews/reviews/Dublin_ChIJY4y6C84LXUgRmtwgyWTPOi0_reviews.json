The decor in the lounge areas is truly charming, and the hotel’s prime location is perfect for exploring the city. Highly recommended! (It was a bonus that some team members spoke Spanish, which helped me handle a quick task more efficiently :))",

Should you be doing a bus tour or using the Airport Express buses, the stops are across the street. We stayed in a family room (two singles and a double bed) that has been very well used over the years, but has a very convenient layout. Housekeeping does a very good job keeping things clean in this hotel. The highlight of your stay will be the very friendly, helpful and approachable staff. Whether it is the doorman, the front desk staff or the particularly great people working in the lovely bar will make this a great experience.",

There’s not much directly outside the hotel for food or bars but you can get to a ton of places in a 10-15 min walk.\n\nDo not bring a car here. There is no parking garage, and the one they tried to send me to for discounted parking was inaccessible due to traffic revisions (transit only) which caused me to circle around Dublin for 40 min before giving up and parking on the street.\n\nDay staff was friendly but can’t say the same for the night manager.",
