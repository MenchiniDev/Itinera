The guys serving were very nice and explained everything there was to know. Im not a fan of QR code menus as a foreigner, but thats probably me. With 5 things and a drink we had a delightful stay. Also tap water is free, big kudo for that!",

In the summer the restaurant is open completely to the outside with outdoor and indoor seating in the breeze, i'e the walls are gone. This creates a lovely atmosphere where you can enjoy the summer life and eat delicious food. Delicatessen is a chain known for its high food quality and excellent service. Albeit slightly on the pricy end, i highly reccommend coming here.",
