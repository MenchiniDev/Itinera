            "text": "A small hotel in a great location for exploring  Krakow and very close to the Jewish Quarter with its great cafes and bars.\nThe rooms are spacious and very clean .\nThe staff are really excellent . So polite and helpful . The breakfast has loads of choice and was plentiful.\n\nIf there are two small things that could improve the experience even more...\nIt would have been nice to have  comfortable sofas or seating somewhere near the bar downstairs so we could have enjoyed a quiet relaxing drink. The dining table seating was not ideal for this .\nThe room scent used in our room 402 was quite overpowering and whilst pleasant , was just too strong.",

            "text": "Pleasant one-night stay. Bit worried that the first thing I saw when I walked into my room was ear plugs on the bedside table but to be honest even as a light sleeper it wasn’t really a problem. (Yes there are trams going past but the double glazing seems pretty good.) There is a restaurant and a spa here but this isn’t necessarily a hotel you’d hang out in - for a place to use as a base to get out and explore Krakow it does the job well. It’s about a ten minute walk to the main square and on the edge of the old Jewish quarter with lots of choices of cafes and restaurants if you explore the streets nearby. The buffet breakfast was fine with a good spread - lots of meats and cheeses, befitting the location. All in all, a recommendable choice.",

Great breakfast, kind that sets you up for the day. Good location, easy walk to old town , ghetto, if doing tours out of city most will collect from hotel. Hoping to return in the future",

They go some extra miles to make your vacation happy. Forgot a charger? They will lend you. Need tram tickets? They will sell you. Whatever you can think of. Fantastic hotel for a Krakow vacation.",
