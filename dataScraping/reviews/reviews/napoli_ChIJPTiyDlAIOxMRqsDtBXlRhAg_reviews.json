            "text": "I recently stayed at this hotel for three nights, and it was an overall delightful experience. The location is perfectâ€”just a short walk from the city center, making it easy to explore the nearby attractions and enjoy a variety of dining options. The hotel itself has a wonderful historic charm, with beautiful architecture and decor that transports you back in time.\n\nThe staff were exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had a comfortable stay. The room was spacious, impeccably clean, and was tidied up every day, which we really appreciated after a long day of sightseeing. The breakfast spread was impressive, offering a wide range of delicious options that catered to different tastes.\n\nIf I had to point out one area for improvement, it would be the elevator, which felt a bit dated and could use some modernization. However, this was a minor inconvenience and didn't detract from the overall experience.\n\nAll in all, this hotel is a hidden gem in the heart of the city, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a blend of comfort, history, and convenience.",

Location of the hotel is perfect for getting around Napoli. We received excellent service from the front desk staff - especially Ruben and Flavia who gave us excellent directions and great recommendations for site and restaurants. Additionally, we arrived at 10 am and we got into our room right away - there was no delay. We couldn't be happier with our stay.",
