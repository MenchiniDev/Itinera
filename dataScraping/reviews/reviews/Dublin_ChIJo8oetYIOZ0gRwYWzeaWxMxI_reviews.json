            "text": "This hotel is beautifully decorated, the staff are genuinely friendly, and the spaces are impeccably clean. However, a note for those who struggle to sleep when overheated: the temperature is centrally controlled by the hotel, likely on a timer. Our room would get warm, prompting us to call the front desk to have the heat turned off, which they politely accommodated. The room would cool down (helped by opening the window, even in December), but after a few hours, the cycle would repeat. Aside from this issue, everything else about our stay was excellent.",

Ross and all the young men on staff that evening made our stay so special. Parking is so handy for a city hotel with a discounted rate for stay at the clarence. Plenty of lively entertainment just around corner. Would def recommend for a short break away.",

Just very hot because we didn’t know how to work the radiator, however opening the windows helped.  Courteous front desk.  Plenty of counter space in bathroom.  Tub didn’t drain well but good water pressure of shower.",

The concierge staff was so welcoming and it was only 11 am but we had just landed from airport and wanted a cocktail. Christopher behind the bar was so friendly and made wonderful cocktails. A suggestion for brunch was made and directions how to walk there. The location is fabulous as we walked everywhere and felt very safe. The River Liffey was a beautiful view on our walks. Highly recommend and much thanks to Christopher ( by the way you can have a cocktail 24/7) gorgeous bar and hotel.",
