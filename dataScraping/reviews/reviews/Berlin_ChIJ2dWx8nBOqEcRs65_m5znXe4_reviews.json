It‚Äôs not a five-star hotel, so I don‚Äôt understand the complaints from people who expect luxury for such a price. It‚Äôs a simple place to rest, take a shower, and then spend the day exploring the vibrant city of Berlin.",

            "text": "First of all it is important to mention that the Generator stays are by far the cheapest options in Berlin!\nHowever there are some negative sides to it, which in my opinion, cannot be excused by the low costs.\nFirst of all the elevators were barely working. Thank god we were in the second floor - anybody who was in the fifth floor for example must have suffered more lol. I also read some reviews from people who had the same problem - so apparently that‚Äôs a common thing there.\nSecond of all I must mention that the room (We had a couple room with a private bathroom) didn‚Äôt seem to be properly clean and the safety hinge of one of the windows was broken.\nAnd last but not least - also what leads to my rather negative rating: We booked a late checkout beforehand (+15‚Ç¨ for checking out by 1pm instead of 10am) but yet the cleaning staff opened our door without permission by 10:30. I was literally half naked and my boyfriend still asleep. It was a total awkward moment and in my eyes more than just a no go. Our keys (cards) stopped working by 11 so we had lots of trouble to get our stuff out of the room.. not going there again. However - the receptionist was very sorry about it and gave us the money for the late check out back! she was a total sweetheart I gotta say.",
