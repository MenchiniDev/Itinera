The food was amazing üòç! We got a lamb boat and the bread was soft, and the lamb, onions, and mayo were just the right continuation! I would highly recommend for a quick bite!",

            "text": "We came over here as they had decent review about their sandwiches. We had 2 different 1 had the # 14 chicken bacon lettuce pickles and request tomatoes.  So e kind of special sauce which is very good. This was a big sandwich and I only ate half now. Finished the rest later for another meal. My husband had, I believe, the # 1 New York sliced beef and onions sandwich.  It comes with all of the same yummy ingredients as mine. Oh, the rolls are long sub rolls soft yet nicely toasted. The meat was warm. Great sandwich for good prices.  We paid $38 US 2 large sandwiches and a large amount of fries. Thanks Guys !!",

This was great for food- I got fries and chicken wrap- both made fresh to order. Very reasonable and service was excellent! Wish I could have gotten a beer with my food only negative",
