(\"less than 600 remaining!\")\n\nUpdate: Staff who told me the ad-spouting could not be turned off have now turned it off and replaced it with music. (Restoring a few stars on the rating.)\n\nUpdate 2: Today, instead of QVC-style sales pitches you got treated to fake-reality TV garbage \"Der Blaulicht Report\" on the P.A. and screens, where people have heated arguments with their neighbours and/or the police. Perfect ambient sound for a relaxing meal! When asked, staff again told me it was impossible to change the channel, so I'm adjusting the ratings accordingly (1-star for the annoying atmosphere, 2-star deduction for the non-service).",
