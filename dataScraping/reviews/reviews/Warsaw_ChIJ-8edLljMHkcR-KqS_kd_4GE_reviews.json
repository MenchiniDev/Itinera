I was surprised how artistically arranged the plate was done. So kudos to the chef! üëè   (Oh and it was 44zl total, with the added fresh raspberries.)\n\nI arrived at 2 PM on a Thursday and there were a lot of free tables, but an hour later it was starting to get kinda busy‚Ä¶ just FYI!

The fruit loops did nothing to the dish but were just there. I wish there were more strawberries, though.\n\nThe seats were swings which was a nice touch :) the overall atmosphere in there is great and they have pizza too. A lot of options to choose from, great place for youngsters :)\n\nThank you Mr pancake!",
