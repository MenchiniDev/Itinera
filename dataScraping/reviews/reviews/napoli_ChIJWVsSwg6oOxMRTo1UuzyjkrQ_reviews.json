They have flat rates for taxis throughout town, recommendations for our stay and a beautiful sitting area for the dining space. The rooms were spacious and clean. The area surrounding the hotel is not a tourist area or an area that you want to hang out in or spend time after dark wandering around. However, it never felt unsafe coming and going.",

            "text": "Surprisingly nice inside. The area and the facade leave a lot to be desired, but once you step in it is evident hat attention to detail and care has been taken into making this hotel look very, very nice inside.\n\nRoom was super clean, toiletries smelled and felt very nice compared to most hotels. Only downside is the wifi is very weak in the rooms. It is however quite fast in the lobby, restaurant and outdoor terrace (which is beautiful by the way).\n\nWe were very pleasantly surprised from the moment we walked in. They served us at the restaurant even though it was 5 minutes prior to closing time and did not rush us in any way (uncommon in Italy when they're about to close). Food was great.\n\nService was great, room was great, atmosphere and decor is that of a much more expensive hotel and it is only a short 10 minute drive from th airport.\n\nHighly recommend it.",

Convenient to both airport and train station, immaculately clean, very friendly and welcoming staff, plus a restaurant and cafe on premise (did not use them, though). There is a very well-stocked supermarket right across the street, which I took advantage of. Neighborhood is fine. I felt safe enough. Mostly residential working class. Definitely would stay here again. Fair price. Good balue.",
