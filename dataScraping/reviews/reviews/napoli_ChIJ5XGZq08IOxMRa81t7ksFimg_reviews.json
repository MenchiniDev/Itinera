Don't change to the metro at the main station as the Google route planner suggests, it's unnecessary and takes longer. Just drive through to the end of the bus line.",

You'll also remember pastiera napoletana and sfogliatelle, but above all, the kindness and smile of the entire staff. The rooms are simple yet elegant. The hotel offers also a small gym and a sleek cocktail bar to its guests. The price vs quality ratio is definitely fair.",
