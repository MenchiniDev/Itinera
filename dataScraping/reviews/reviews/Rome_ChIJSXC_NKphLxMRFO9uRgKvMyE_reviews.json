The staff were amazing, endless reservations made for us with great recommendations. We never had to touch our luggage, and a taxi was called for us when we checked out. I've never experienced such a great place. I loved the area and got to get to know it very quickly. I wouldn't change a thing about our stay, it was wonderful.",

We were upgraded to a room with a fantastic balcony and welcomed with a bottle of champagne and cupcake. Definitely will stay here again on our next trip to Rome. I also love that the lobby had free umbrellas to rent which was perfect for a rainy afternoon.",

I‚Äôm disgusted it is classed as five star.\n\nWe booked this hotel through Holidaze travel agents and stayed 9th September 2022 with my partner William Thomas.\n\n- Room filthy (hair in shower / sink, towels dirty and we found someone else‚Äôs clothes in our wardrobe!).\n- Staff obnoxious.\n- Cleaners stole my jewellery and bra!!!!! When I reported this to reception their response was ‚Äòhow much is the jewellery worth?‚Äô. I felt like they were missing the point - theft is theft.\n\nI wish we had a Time Machine as I would never have booked this awful hotel! After enjoying our days out in the beautiful city of Rome, we dreaded coming back to that disgrace of a hotel.",
