And only one person work in reception.\n\n- Housekeeping is terrible , my room was not cleaned during my entire stay. (I was leave at 3pm and put cleaning room sign but no one did the room).\n\n- There is a small internal staircase in the corridors of some rooms (maybe three or four steps) which may be tiring for the elderly.\n\n- The soundproof in the room is poor, I upgraded my room to have a view, it was a view of a lively pedestrian street but the music was loud at night and could be heard inside the room\n\n- There is no free bottle of water in the room.",

Room view meh, but it was well appointed, temp control was easy.  There is a little bar with the restaurant but they will be happy to bring a drink down to a very plush lounge downstairs.  Really close to great food, and the museum next door is pretty good.  Very reasonable room rate, breakfast is nice.  They are happy to book transport to the airport and other sites.  Great place, would stay here again.",
