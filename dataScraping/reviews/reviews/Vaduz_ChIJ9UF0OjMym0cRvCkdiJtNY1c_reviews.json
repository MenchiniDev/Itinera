            "text": "My mom has been living in Büelriet in Sevelen for two months now.\nShe is cared for sensitively and warmly and feels very comfortable. We were able to furnish the spacious room wonderfully with her furniture so that it is her home again and feels like it. Only the bed and bedside table are from Büelriet.\nThe food tastes excellent and we were always very satisfied. The service is always friendly and takes the time to chat with guests and residents.\nAll around a good experience! I am extremely grateful that my mom has a beautiful and loving home even in this phase of her life.\n.",
