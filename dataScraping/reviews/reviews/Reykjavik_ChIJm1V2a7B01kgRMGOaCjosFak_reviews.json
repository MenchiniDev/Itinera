I received excellent service and product from this store.\nWhen I called to order, I was told they normally don't take orders over the phone.  I explained that I couldn't get the website or app to work. The operator went the extra mile! Took my order and delivered it as promised! My driver was in full uniform and polite.  This was a great experience in a foreign country. I always look forward to stores like this one with well train staff to take care of the customer!",
