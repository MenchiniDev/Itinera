Our server was a little forgetful and made me feel like everything I asked for was ignored (unless my husband asked for it) which was weird. But the food outweighed the service.",

We come from Canada, but are not French speaking which did not stop the waiters and manager(?) from coming over and making conversation with us. The drinks (mojito and wine) were great. Tapas better. Especially enjoyed the special of the day with chorizo feature. We were given a digestif drink on the house before we left and well wishes by many of the staff on our way out! Highly enjoyed. Fair prices also, 58€ for two with 6 tapas, 2 deserts and 2 drinks.",
