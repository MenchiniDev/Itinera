The waiter was a bit grumpy and slow, but the food was delicious and fine. Stray cats were running around. The building has some charm but needs a renovation with the garden. A grill plate for two persons plus some beer costed appr. 120 RON. Credit cards accepted.",

The place is quite fancy in my opinion but I was there for a celebration so that’s might be why it left me this impression. The waiters were very welcoming!",

Being in the middle of the city of Bucharest, should look at their old reputation, one of a kind in the whole city!\nFood is very good, atmosphere depends on who is with you, service looks a bit from other epoque.",
