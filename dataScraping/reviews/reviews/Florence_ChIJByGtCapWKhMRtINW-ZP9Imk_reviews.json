They promptly address any concerns or issues that you may have and make sure that you feel like a valued customer before you check out.  The service here has been excellent and tailored to the needs of every guest.  My wife and I were very impressed and the hotel has earned lifetime loyalty on our end every time we’ll come to Florence.",

Would like to personally thank the concierge Alessandro for going beyond to help in our specific question.\n\nThe room was very nice, clean and met our expectations fully.\n\nThe only not good thing happened after checkout when the hotel, from my point of view made some incorrect operations with my banking card in terms of pre-authorization and then authorization which in the end led to big problems with a sum of money stuck in hold and cannot still be released.\nThis led to some budget inconvenience, because we were just at the beginning of our trip to Italy.\n\nReported this to the hotel, but unfortunately they were not very eager to look thoroughly into what went wrong, though provided their feedback.\n\nThis is generally is not a rare occasion with hotels when they treat your bank accounts not they they should and without proper communication with the guest.",
