All the seafood was very very fresh, and well seasoned. Great open space with amazing balcony view of sunset to add! The staff was very kind, attentive, and made us feel relaxed. Definitely a memorable treat in Marseille.",

It is expensive, but nothing unexpected for a place of this caliber. We particularly enjoyed the catch of the day which was a 3.6 kg sea bass that they split among 6 of us. They even brought the fish out before cooking it to let us inspect it (it was a good looking fish but I’m not going to pretend I knew what to look for!).",

The service was impeccable. We loved our dining alcove on the 2nd floor (very quiet) and the pacing of the food service was relaxed.\nThey were able to accommodate my husband’s gluten allergy (celiac) with many menu options.\nThe bouillabaisse was the highlight as well as the Fresh fish of the day (John Dory). The swordfish plate and the monkfish dish were also delicious!\nPeron was a dining highlight while in Marseille!",
