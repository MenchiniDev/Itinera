We also received some bread with truffle butter, both regular and gluten free.\nAmong the main dishes were: rack of lamb, cod, tiger shrimp salad, one of the chicken dishes, and plaice. Everyone was extremely happy with their choices. Overall, the dinner was extraordinary.\n\nGF situation note: Not only did we received gluten free bread, but also the dishes we requested were adjusted to accommodate. While there are no markings or notes on the menu, asking the server is enough to learn if the dish can be prepared for you.",
