The bar could have stayed open for a bit longer than 11.30m , but the staff are extremely professional and friendly. Especially Dylan was a great banter and exceptional talent behind the bar. Would definitely come back with my colleagues next time .",

            "text": "Our check-in with Martina was excellent. Despite the long queue and the need to switch lines after the manager informed us they were closing the \"Priority Line,\" Martina remained friendly and helpful the entire time. She offered great recommendations for places to grab a bite and made the process much smoother. The room was spotless, and the bed was incredibly comfy—overall, a wonderful experience.\nThe little store close to reception was often closed, which was disappointing. Also, options for your welcome drink - which we forgot when we arrived, were very limited to take away.",

When asked, they provide it but the guest needs to come to the reception to get it. This is a service for a 3 star hotel.\nThere are some really nice employers there and some unfortunately not so friendly!",
