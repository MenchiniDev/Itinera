            "text": "One of my favourite hotel stays . The rooms were small (we had a compact double ) but perfectly formed and well equipt . I was concerned about feeling cramped but I didn't at all. It was easy to store bags so they were well away and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.The bathroom was spacious with a great shower. There is also a communal kitchen you can use for tea or to make dinner .The hotel was spotlessly clean .\nBut! The very best thing was the breakfast . It was an incredible Swedish buffet with an amazing set of options and cracking coffee. We ate in the restaurant one night too and it was lovely .\nThe service was exceptional, all the staff were kind and attentive. We had a lovely waiter the night we ate there and as we left a staff member gave me a recipe. We won't stay anywhere else in Stockholm now .",

            "text": "Nice quiet location in the green, in a former prison and with a beach, where we could have a swim. The double room was clean, had comfy beds, and had a good shape bathroom. Very friendly staff. We loved the originality of the venue, the tiny museum and sitting in the garden of the restaurant. Plenty of free privat parking spaces available. Within a 10 minutes  there were also public transports.\nWe would love to come back.",
