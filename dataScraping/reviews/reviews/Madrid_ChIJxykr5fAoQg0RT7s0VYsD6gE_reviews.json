I can go on and on about everything  I loved about this place but, it should cover it all when I say “hands down, no doubt the best meal I have had while traveling through Spain.” I hated the meal to end. The service and staff/management was outstanding. I have one more day in Madrid and just might have to go back again tomorrow!!",
