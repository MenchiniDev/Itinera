I rang the bell for several minutes, but unfortunately, no one responded. Eventually, an individual approached me and informed me that the hotel had gone bankrupt and had subsequently shut down.",

The vintage bar downstairs is good with amazing food.\nRooms and washroom are big enough for two people with good window view.\n\nThe only part which they lack is not providing kettle in the room and no washroom basics like soap,shampoo and dental kit.",

It had a private bathroom that was small, but the bed was nice, the desk was adequate. We were on the street side and I could not hear the traffic. I would stay here again and will recommend to my friends.",

Can take 40 minutes by walk (you need to have strong legs like mine;))\n- too narrow entry gate and too small elevator, is not wheel chair friendly",
