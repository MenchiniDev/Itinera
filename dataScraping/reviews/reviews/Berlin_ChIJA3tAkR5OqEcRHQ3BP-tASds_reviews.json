            "text": "We were told this was a must place to dine in Berlin, so we definitely had to stop by. We arrived at 2:30PM and were told we had to place our food orders by 3PM and drinks by 3:30PM, as it closes at 4PM. This was easy, as they had a menu in English. The service was friendly, the food came out quickly, and everything was delicious. I also was able to cross three things off my Germany food bucket list: pretzels, mettwurst, and pork knuckle. All the food was a hit, and 10/10 would highly recommend.",

            "text": "A few people who are visiting BERLIN may want to see what a German Beer Hall looks like in real life. This is the place to come. The place is huge. It can hold over 400 people sitting plus.\n\nOne of the specialties is the Wienerschnitzel. I have to say it‚Äôs a little bit pricey but worth it and big enough. They cooked it just right nice and tender. As you see, served with two lemons and side of potatoes or salad depending on what you like.\n\nThey have two other styles of schnitzel the Vietnamese style and Chicken Schnitzel, which are a bit cheaper than ‚Ç¨29.60 for the Original Wiener Schnitzel.\n\nOne thing that might be interesting for you it‚Äôs called a Brizza. It is a pretzel Pizza basically. It has various toppings you can choose from.\n\nYou also seen the photo a half liter of beer half full. Not normal Berlin prices it‚Äôs a bit expensive but if you‚Äôre a tourist you can afford it. Why not?\n\nI had to say the evening I was there it was full, but the service was quite fast. I mean, after ordering my drink and ordering the meal it took less than five minutes to be on the table.\n\nI did have a look through the place and they do have a stage. So apparently they have live music every now and then to entertain the people. I‚Äôm sure during Oktoberfest place is rammed.\n\nYou'll find very very locals there. But the atmosphere is as nice as it can be.",
