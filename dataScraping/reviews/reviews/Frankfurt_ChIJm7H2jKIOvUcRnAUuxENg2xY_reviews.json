Unfortunately there was no heating the first night I slept in and I had to ask for an electrical heating device in the middle of the night. Next day the maintenance guy came to fix it, saying they renewed the whole heating system but I guess they forgot to check if every room is properly heated.",

Loved the breakfast buffet, by far the best we've ever had. Liked the clean neighbourhood. Liked the proximity to restaurants and train. Liked the bike hire facility downstairs.  The hafenpark park nearby has to be one of the nicest parks in the world, full of happy people chilling out. A lot of business people there but we thought it was romantic for us as a couple. Excellent value too.",
