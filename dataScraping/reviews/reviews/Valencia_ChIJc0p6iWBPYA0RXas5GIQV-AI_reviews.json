            "text": "I‚Äôve been going to this restaurant for the past many years, and chose it for our New Year‚Äôs Eve celebration. We couldn‚Äôt have had a worse new year. They barely had vegetarian options. We ordered our starters and mains, we‚Äôre promptly served our starters. The mains for the meat eaters came but no vegetarian mains. We waited and finally 15 minutes later mentioned that we were still waiting. Only when we brought it to their notice did they tell us they were out of tofu! Imagine if we had waited longer. At this point it was past 11. She said the only option was stir fried vegetables. Needless to say we ordered that because we had no choice. If you have a full restaurant, make sure you stock up. This was absolutely disappointing, especially considering they only had two vegetarian main dish options!",
