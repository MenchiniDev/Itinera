Nice, modern and clean rooms with enough space for essentials.\nPersonnel is super kind and helpful, Bogda and Magdalena were incredible at the front desk.\nJust 12’ walking to main square and 2’ walking to bus stop for airport.\nThere are groceries stores called SABKA opens from 6-11 pm, super convenient (there’s one 2 blocks away).\nThe hotel has a nice terrace bar, too.",

The hotel is about a 15 min walk to market square.\nThe outlook in the outside area is disappointing, lovely terrace but spoilt by a block of flats overlooking, not sure if higher fence trees would improve it, this didn't spoil our stay as we were out most of the day and evening.  I wouldn't hesitate staying here again",

Comfy beds, nice shower/bathroom etc. Its a short 10/15 minute walk to the town centre/castle which was ideal for us. Would 100% stop here again if we come back to Krakow",
