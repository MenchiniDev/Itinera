The stuff I don’t like them my friend he still eating and she want to take the plate. I was eating once I finish a girl come behind me and took the plate very fast without even ask the pizza still in my hand.\n\nWe have been waiting for the order more than 40 minutes. One more thing that you can not create your pizza I am vegetarian and I asked her to take out the pork meat change it with some other vegetables she said no we can not.\n\nThe price it is acceptable.",
