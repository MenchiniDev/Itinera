I would describe the breakfast at the City Hotel as the best of the hotels in the European cities I have visited.  So many different and delicious dishes and drinks, really awesome.  With all care to cover dishes for people with a special type of diet.  Four coffee machines!  The hotel is a top ten! ðŸ‘Œ",

They were trying a new environmental policy: for every day you agree that your room wasn't to be cleaned, you got a free drink in the terrace bar - we didn't need fresh towels, so enjoyed a glass of wine at sunset on the terrace bar.\nAnd the breakfast was brilliant - a massive choice of warm and cold option, as well as bowls of peaches, apricots, apples, grapes, bananas.\nIt's much recommended all round.",
