            "text": "This place is the combination of the cafe, bar, and restaurant area. I had a 3-meal course at â‚¬39 for lunch. Itâ€™s cost-worthy in my opinion. The portion is perfect and satisfying (not too full).\n\nâœ¨Starter: A reindeer pie with some greens and pickled onion. Love the pickled pink onion. Refreshing and well balanced.\nâœ¨Main: Catch of the day is haddock. Mild flavour, firm flesh, and moist. Goes so well with the creamy sauce and the crispy veggies.\nâœ¨Dessert: Apple cake with apple puree and citrus sorbet. Clean up the heavy taste from the first two courses.\n\nðŸ“ŒDownside: Lost a star because of the â‚¬1.4 they charged me for the tap water.",

The lemony cheesecake was average and the coffee was okay. The staff are not as attentive as other venues close by. Stop by for a coffee and cake to enjoy the location.",

Salmon soup lacks flavor and depth, venison and reindeer were too chewy and too strong gamey flavor, the salmon was nice. Side dishes for all dishes were below average for the price you pay. Maybe they are catering this place for tourists but for sure can get better reindeer steak elsewhere in Helsinki.",
