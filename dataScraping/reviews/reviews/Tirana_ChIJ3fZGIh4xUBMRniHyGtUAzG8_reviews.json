The location in the park makes Juvenilja Castle a perfect escape from the busy city and the best part is that itâ€™s close to the major neighborhoods in Tirana.\n\nThe food was delicious and the service was fast. Perhaps the waiters were not very cheerful and energetic but they did the job right. I highly recommend trying this restaurant at least once, but please make sure to avoid visiting during hectic days like on the weekend, if you prefer a quiet place and fast service.",

One thing i would recommend to the Staff is to be a bit careful with the service! I think the service could use a bit of improvement because we had an unpleasant situation the last time. However that even would not shade our experience. Would recommend it!",

The food was served so late and there wasn't justifiable because in total there was 3 tables occupied. One dish never came but present in the bill. When we ordered the dessert(not delicious like i was expecting) the waitress gives a look to the watch meaning: is late for the dessert. At the and the price was not worth what we received. I will go back probably only for coffee. Nothing else. So disappointed.",
