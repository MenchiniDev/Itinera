            "text": "One of the oldest bars in Bucharest. You'll find people there any day of the week and the prices are usually low, but the fact that it's placed in a basement with a single exit and that the building might collapse any time make me avoid the place. Besides that, the bouncers are among the rudest I've ever seen and there are chances you might leave with a black eye if they don't like you.\nThe bar/bistro on the ground floor serves pretty decent food at extremely good prices. The salads and pizza are delicious. The only problem is ventilation (or the lack of it), making it hard to breath inside. The terrace (or, more precisely, the tables on the sidewalk) is fine during the summer.",
