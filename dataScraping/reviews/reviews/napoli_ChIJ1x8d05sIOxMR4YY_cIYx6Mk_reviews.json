It features immaculate vibes, an elegant atmosphere, friendly waiters, and gourmet food. Located right next to the policlinico where med students attend classes, Napoli Napoli is a breath of fresh air after a day of long studies. Special shout out to Francesco, the coolest waiter ever. 10/10, gotta go there at least once.",

Even after we asked for the bill it took them 15 minutes to return to our table. Maybe it was an exception on january 1st.",
