You can try zip line, archery with gun and bow, kids activities and wonderful trails starting from hotel, right to the summit of Trebević mountain. The food was not my cup of tea, but for the price, what they are offering, it is a great deal. I recommend it for group seminars and conferences.",

Zip line is overpriced and the most annoying thing about the whole place are bird and nature sounds played over the speakers, because they sound forced and unnatural, forcing to you to leave perhaps even sooner than you intended.",

            "text": "The resort is located on Mt. Trebević, a few hundred meters from Hotel Pino Nature. The location is lovely, though lacking in natural shade so it gets very hot during the day in summer. My little one loved the adrenaline park and it's zipline, and for the price of 2 euros it was more than worth it. The much scarier adult Zipline is 4 euros and worth every penny. The food is very basic, and if you decide to spend the night the breakfast will leave you wanting more. A lot more. The people working on the adrenaline course are great with kids, but the rest of the staff are not at all happy working there and it shows. All in all, I recommend it for the short fun it provides to the kids and adults, but not for the food, drink, or lodgings. Also a big minus, no alcoholic beverages at all.",
