The bathroom is big and nice.\n\nBreakfast; not bad, the options are reasonable but I must say that two staff are not enough for breakfast service.\n\nIn general, it is an old-fashioned hotel and an ideal choice for those who like that old-fashioned nostalgic atmosphere.",

The rooms are very clean, have all the amenities; air conditioning, comfortable beds, nice bathroom. Towels are changed daily. Delicious and rich breakfasts. The restaurant, reception and hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. We found everything in the hotel to rest comfortably and have a nice time in Milan. I highly recommend it and thank you!",

Moreover, they refused to solve some problems at the reception, they asked for napkins that were not in the room, but we were refused saying that there were no napkins in the hotel, there was too little choice at breakfast, there was no kettle in the room and they refused to bring glass cups for tea, offering cardboard ones, in the restaurant you can only eat - and this is normal if the bar is open, but by 10 o'clock in the evening it was closed, at the reception they refused to bring water to the room, we had to go up to the sixth floor, although for the first time they brought water to the room, the only plus that I can highlight is this location, after reading positive reviews that seem to be fake, I don't understand what the hotel is a masterpiece?
