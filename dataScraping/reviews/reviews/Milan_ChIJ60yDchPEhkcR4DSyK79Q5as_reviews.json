            "text": "It’s perfect for my needs. The bed is bigger than a twin but smaller than a full, I think, (in any case, there’s room to flip around). It’s clean, and I feel safe here. The people at the desk were nice. It was less expensive than the other hotels/Airbnb’s and I am just here for one night before flying back home. There are several good charging options. I think I’m only subtracting one star for the room because I’ve been in luxury hotels the last six nights as part of a tour, and I would say maybe this is just a small notch down even though I still find it quite comfortable.\nI included a picture of the toilet because it was a slightly strange shape with, for me, a bit of a feeling of falling in. Not tragic, just odd. And then have you ever seen such an elaborate shower? I didn’t try to figure out the jacuzzi jets, just used the showerhead.",
