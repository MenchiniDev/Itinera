            "text": "While the area it's situated in doesn't impress, it only adds to the surprise that you get once you enter the hotel. It's a very modern interior, with well decorated hallways. The rooms are very clean, a good size with plenty of storage space and the bathrooms are well equipped. The beds are surprisingly comfortable, providing a good night's sleep. The staff have been supremely welcoming and friendly, even more so as I don't speak Polish. Everyone was very accommodating and I always got the sense that my needs were a priority. If there is one criticism I have it'd have to be the internet speed. On average I was getting about 2mbps. Breakfast was included in the price, but I haven't tried it so I can't speak to the quality of the food. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to those that wish to stay within easy reach of central Krakow at a reasonable price. Given the opportunity, I would happily stay here again.",
