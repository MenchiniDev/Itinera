The menu is short, the food - simple, but very well done, better than expected. The girl waiting on us was super nice. Overall a very pleasant experience, highly recommend.",

There are only a few different dishes available, coming with homemade bread and dips as well as salads, that were exceptionally good. Main course was also good, my suggestion is to go with meat.\nVery cool experience, at a reasonable price for the quality provided.",
