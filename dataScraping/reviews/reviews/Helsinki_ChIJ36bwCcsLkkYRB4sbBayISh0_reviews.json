            "text": "Lappi provided a delicious introduction to the Lappish cuisine of Northern Finland.\n\nThe menu is not particularly large but has enough variety to cater to lots of different tastes. There is a focus on reindeer meat and salmon. To start we had the lohikeitto or salmon chowder which had large pieces of potato and salmon, you can even get this as a main if you prefer. For the main course we got various types of reindeer and salmon and all were very good.\n\nService was excellent and the staff were extremely gracious and accommodating, they were even able to add a third guest to our booking which I really appreciated as I understand how difficult it can be when the restaurant is very full.\n\nPrices were reasonable given the uniqueness of their offering and quality of the food. Would recommend for visitors to Helsinki!",

We were given the best seat in the restaurant! The interior looks so cozy and traditional: captures the Finn aesthetic very well. Great place for newcomers to this country! üíØ\n\nThe service was LOVELY and it‚Äôs great that the menu isn‚Äôt massive either. They all speak English there and we had the English menu as well ü´∂\n\nThe bread and butter that came before the food was a really good way to leap into Finnish cuisine. I LOVE rye bread and this is exactly what I needed!\n\nWe went with the salad as the starter which surprised us as to HOW DELICIOUS IT WAS. Next came our fish mains and they were cooked really well. Lots of warm flavours came out. The desserts were again very worthwhile. Absolutely recommend the Lapland Farmer cheese dessert!\n\nPlease GO HERE as they serve traditional Finn food üòç\n\nMy husband and I shall be back!",
