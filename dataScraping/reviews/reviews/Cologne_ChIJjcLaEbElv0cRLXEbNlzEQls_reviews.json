Recommend ordering a half one if possible. Pork knuckles are typically cooked in two versions, the slow cooked and grilled crispy schweinshaxe they serve here or the eisbein which is not crisped. The preparations takes some 40 minutes and is Worth the Wait. They only accept cash, several ATMs are avalible nearby. Enjoy.",
