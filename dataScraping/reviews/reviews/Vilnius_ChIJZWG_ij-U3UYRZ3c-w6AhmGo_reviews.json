My dish - veal with mushrooms and potatoes - taste was literally like at home cooked by my mom üòÄ\nSecond important point was amazing service - the server was so attentive, entertaining, has great people skills and of course a great knowledge of menus - both food and wine.\nThird important point was the location and beautiful views - it was very warm and we had a table outside the restaurant.\nWe had a great experience and wish you the same.",

Food varies from super tasty sausages to really nice seafood dishes . Also great selection of German beers . Prices are not low but half of the dishes are big enough for two people. Would suggest sausage platter and  'karka' . Deserts were tasty as well .",
