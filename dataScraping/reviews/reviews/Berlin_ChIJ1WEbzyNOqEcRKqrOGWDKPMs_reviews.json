            "text": "Classic German cuisine! It’s a small place with maybe 8-10 tables , but they sat us easily as a large group (6) on a Thursday! I had the meatballs and I thought they were wickedly good. Nothing overpowering, just good classic food. Beer was good, felt so nice and cozy and what I expected in Germany as a Canadian. Although, the apple tart looked beautiful and smelled amazing, it was just okay tasting. (I’ll take a Canadian apple pie any day over it, sorry!)",

A smaller menu but everything was delicious and homely, perfectly complimented the old history of the restaurant. The best thing on the menu was the dessert and the roasted pork knuckle",
