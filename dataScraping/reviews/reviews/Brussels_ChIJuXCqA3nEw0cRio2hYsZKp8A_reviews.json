I ordered the Ravioli filled with ricotta and spinach, which was 21 euro. I could've excused the price, if it weren't for the fact that the plate had only 4 pieces of ravioli (albeit bigger than normal, but not enough to feed one person; i was still hungry when i left) and it came with a sauce that wasn't even mentioned in the menu.",

The beef was overcooked in some parts, but still good. The salmon was perfect! They have a very good Thai tea! The ice cream is was pure and sugar and they need to improve the gluten free options. But the restaurant is super nice! Congratulations.",
