            "text": "Sorry, but 4 stars for this place is completely unjustified!\n\nThis is the former “Antares Hotel Accademia,” with only minor fixes. We booked the “Superior Double” based on glowing reviews, expecting a fantastic stay. Instead, it was a huge letdown. We don’t usually complain, but this room was ridiculously small. You walk in and immediately hit your legs on the bed—no exaggeration.\n\nWe were there with my 4-year-old niece and had a flight at 5 in the morning. When we checked out to go to our car, we were appalled to see prostitutes right in front of the hotel door, soliciting cars. Apparently, this is their regular spot.\n\nThe restaurant was good, even though we were the only two people there. The risotto was excellent.",

            "text": "It’s a nice hotel 20 min walk from Milan Convention center. Nice service, always helpful. Had umbrellas for rainy days. Good connection to the center but a bit far, takes 1 hour to get to the center with public transport. Breakfast was ok, didn’t change in 3 days. I didn’t like the hair fan - very heavy and hard to use. Gym was small but nice, many good programs. It was pretty hot in the gym though, no air. 1 hour to the Bergamo airport, depends on thebtraffic - it was faster to get out from the city (apprx 40 min) than to it (1.5 hrs).",
