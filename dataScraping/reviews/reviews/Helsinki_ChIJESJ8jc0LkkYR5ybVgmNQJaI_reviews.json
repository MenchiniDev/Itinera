It went well with the green pea puree. The only problem was that the amount of fish compared to the price was low. My friends ordered some vegeterian and pasta dishes. They were also happy with their foods.",

            "text": "Best burger I've had in my life. I came here 2 years later to write this because it's stuck in my mind. Ever single burger since then has been compared, and not a single one was half as good as the godly burger I had on Oct 19th 2021.\n\nI don't know if the stars aligned and chef got lucky, or if it's something that is repeatable. It doesn't matter. It was the perfect hamburger. I literally cried when I took a bite. I stopped everything I was doing and enjoyed each bite carefully because I knew from that moment on I was ruined.\n\nMy friends are sick of me talking about it. If I wasn't shy I'd have asked the chef for the recipe.\n\nThe sauce was outstanding. The meat was incredibly juicy and flavourful, the bun was soft while also being crispy and buttery. They didn't overwhelm it with too much lettuce, tomato, and onion.\n\nThank you for this memorable experience. I pray I can find this level of pleasure from a meal again in my life.\n\nAnd if you think I'm exaggerating to be funny I'm not. I'm dead serious.",
