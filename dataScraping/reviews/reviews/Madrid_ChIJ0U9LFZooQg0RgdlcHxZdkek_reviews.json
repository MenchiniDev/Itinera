The staff were brilliant and very helpful and the location is great for access to local attractions, shopping, bars & restaurants... Plus only a 15-20 min taxi ride from the airport. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.",

Upscale , Safe and quiet neighbourhood.\nThe rooms are great size with a little kitchenette and the staff are super helpful..\nThe only caveat  is that they are doing construction on the hotel restaurant and starting around 7:30 am u can clearly gear that in ur room  which is makes it impossible to sleep",

Their lighting is horrible, ultra bright white lights in the rooms, makes you feel you're in a laboratory or something like that. Beds are decent!",

Breakfast isn’t worth the money unfortunately,very low key, no buffet, small portions and limited choice. Better to have that elsewhere.",
