            "text": "If you are driving, this hotel is definitely   a wrong choice. The entrance is small and  awkward , unless you have a tiny car your car will surely get  damaged, and you are paying 15 euros a night for damaging your car,\nwhich is going to cost you in excess of 1000£s. Furthermore the parking lot smells of raw sewerage.\nOverall appearance is far from 3star . More like 1 star. Hardly any toiletries, no extra pillows, when asked at the reception we were told there were none left, no kettles in the rooms, safe was jammed , airconditioner out of  order in one of the  room. Carpets were bit tired and bedding needed updating.\nTwo gentlemen at the front desk were nice and polite but the lady night  at the night desk was mean and rude.\nI will not choose this hotel again and would not recommend to any one. You can get much better hotel at this price.",

The hotel was easy to find, clean and ideal for a weekend away considering the fantastic price.",
