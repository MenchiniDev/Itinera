As for how decoratively busy it is, \"gaudy\" comes from Gaudí. Obviously not to everyone's taste, but yeah lots of us like the busy and loud styling.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about the outside is the first gen towers on the first two facades not conforming to the design system Gaudi implemented later on. Suboptimal but it adds to the whimsy of the building too.\n\nThe Sandcastle thing is a feature of it all, not a detraction or accident. Gaudí had a unique way of understanding structural materials as plastic and moldable. That dreamy playfulness is a huge draw of Gaudi imo.",
