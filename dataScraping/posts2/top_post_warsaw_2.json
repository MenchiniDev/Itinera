This was in 2014-2016, so thing might have changed since then.\n\nWarsaw University of Technology was a lot about proper computer SCIENCE. Understanding how computers actually work, getting full general knowledge but teaching little to nothing about actual programming.\n\nWhen I later switched to PJAIT, it was ALL about programming in different languages, databases, I also had to do some classes from the first year to make up for the differences in the programs - when I was learning about the architecture of the first processors in WUT, they were learning advanced MS Excel on their fist year.\n\nAll in all - doesnâ€™t really matter which one you finish, but WUT will give you a proper understanding of computers and teach very little about actual commercial programming, whilst PJAIT will make you a fairly decent junior developer with close to zero understanding of the SCIENCE part of computer science \n\nGL",
