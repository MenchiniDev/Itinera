            "body": "There are some churches outside of the old town, but the concentration is indeed lower. It's likely because quite a lot of newer districts were developed in soviet times, where practicing the faith wasn't exactly encouraged. Current development is more profit oriented, the newest neighborhoods don't even have enough schools, kindergartens, green areas, so churches sure aren't a priority.",

            "body": "Hi! The reason why a lot of the Catholic Churches are in the Centre and in the general area of Vilnius Old Town is because these were mainly the historic areas of Vilnius City, from the time of the dukes. A lot of religious orders settled in Vilnius and a lot of worker guilds wanted to market and promote themselves as well (hence why they donated and helped out in the construction of serveral churches). It sort of made sense to build a lot of these churches close by since again, most of the population lived in a walkable distance to these churches in those days. \n\nThey are churches in the outskirts as well. But for the vast majority of people, they lived in a walkable distance to the centre and the centre generally had better stability and security (owning to the historic wall of Vilnius city, the remains of which can still be seen). It made sense to have these churches inside the area the historic wall covered rather than outside (since these churches contained either a lot of relics, art, statues, conventional riches, books).\n\nVilnius is called Rome of the North (tbf the Lithuanians themselves don't know this, it's a niche informational detail only those well versed in history would know). If you visit Rome, you'll often see many large cathedrals and churches very close to each other. Even the main streets of Rome, have churches built mere minutes away from each other.\n\nThe churches in Vilnius have a Roman influence on them (design wise) not to mention that during the commonwealth area, they were an influex of Italian painters and artists that moved to Vilnius. It's possible this is another reason why a lot of the churches were built close by each other (potential Roman influence + makes logistics a bit more manageable)\n\nApologies for spelling errors or bad formatting, had a tiring day. Hope this answer helps.",
