There are ticket counters at every (larger) train station in Vienna.  \n  \nThe go-to website is the website of the austrian federal train service (ÖBB):\nhttps://shop.oebbtickets.at/de/ticket  \n  \nThey also have a (very easy to use) app:  \nhttps://www.oebb.at/de/tickets-kundenkarten/online-mobile-ticketing/oebb-app",
