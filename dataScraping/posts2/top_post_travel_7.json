Step 3 is done within hours, and Step 2 can be accelerated if you’re flexible enough, e.g. going to other locations, frequently checking for cancellations, or just doing the interview upon return from an international trip. But Step 1 is completely beyond your control.\n\nAs you can see, many people are approved pretty quickly, within a week, but there are others who have to wait months for conditional approval. And, unfortunately, it’s impossible to predict which batch you’re in.\n\nIf you traveling internationally with some degree of frequency, I’d just apply for GE and wait however long it takes. Perhaps you’ll be lucky and have it done quickly and problem solved. At least it’s a one-time wait.",
