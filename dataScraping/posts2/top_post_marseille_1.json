I've already had questions about this and I understand your reasoning. /r/marseille might be just a redirect but it is how a lot of people find out about /r/aixmarseille (which is the oldest sub about the city)  and I'd like to keep it this way. Besides there is /r/marseilleTV which anyone is more than welcome to use and which is linked in the sidebar of /r/aixmarseille. \n\nThe main thing though is that I don't think there is that much interest about the show. All French reviews have blasted it and having seen a couple episodes myself I didn't find it very good (it's not the worst thing ever though). ",
