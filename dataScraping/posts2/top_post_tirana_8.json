Mostly offer a deal food plus music. \nAlthough most of the local stay at home some prefer bigger settings and they dance the night away. \n\nI think this will more authentic than going to a pub after 12am to drink. It will be overcrowded plus overpriced.\nRestaurant and then at the Skenderbeg square for the concert.",
