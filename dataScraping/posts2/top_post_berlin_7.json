            "body": "While it's fun to criticize BVG, and I don't pretend like they're perfect, bus service faces a lot of issues that make things challenging. \n\n1-there is a shortage of drivers and getting new ones trained takes time.  Maneuvering those buses on an empty road is hard enough, fill it with a lot of cars, traffic lights and pedestrians and the complexity goes way up.\n\n2-car traffic is everywhere and many roads in Berlin are single lane in each direction. The buses get stuck just like everyone else.  Even when there is a bus lane, it is not unusual for a car to be traveling in it.\n\n3-buses must drive defensively.  If an accident was avoidable, even if it wasn't the driver's fault, they will still get in trouble. I've certainly seen lots of behavior from car drivers where they absolutely do not respect the bus.\n\n4-traffic lights and their timing is another problem although this affects everyone. Most lights in Berlin seem to be on a timer with no smarts to them. As someone who likes to ride his bike, going 3 lights without hitting a red is pretty much impossible. Better technology around this would improve everyone's lives.",

What could help on the other hand is a better, more dependable public transport. So here I am crossing fingers that BVG will start on routes that are easy to handle for the robobuses.",

People should get higher paying jobs elsewhere. The government needs to institute AI where it can and balance that out with jobs and better pay somewhere else",

Fact is that the jobs that are left become more and more rare/useless/inefficient. \n\nI think that is why there is such a worry about replacing jobs. The bus drivers become unemployed through no fault of their own, but there are no jobs that they can pick up, or it will be something among the lines of \"filling out numbers in an excel file while not really understanding why or what for\" \n\nI'm just not convinced that autonomous driving will really help the BVG in the long term. Why not start with subway lines that are way less prone to outside interference?",
