I believe we have the oldest continuously running political system in the world, certainly of any major nation at any rate. England has been a remarkably stable nation for at least the last 800 years. And it's all tremendously well documented. I think the way we treat history as a nation is outstanding. I don't think there's anywhere in the world that can quite match our pure abundance and accessibility of history, since most of it is also accessible for free. So many stately homes, all with their own unique pasts. And then you drive through the Lake District and you're left wondering how long the structures have been there for. I often thing some of the drystone walls used by farmers must have been in place for centuries in some instances.",

Now we have woodlands and small scattered forests. The trees cannot regenerate because the deer population is wildly out of control because most natural predators were eradicated, such as bears, wolves and lynx. Many bird species, especially predators like eagles and raptors, were eradicated. \n\nEven the seas weren't safe. 100 years ago the Humber estuary was home to Europe's largest oyster beds. 50 years ago they went extinct in the area. They never naturally returned. However, they have now imported some oysters from elsewhere in Europe in order to help them return. Ironically the Humber used to have a large export market to help strengthen mainland European populations. Burbot, a large fish, are also extinct.\n\nMost of the marshes and wetlands have been drained and the rivers artificially straightened, which in turn adversely effects fish reproduction. Our rivers are polluted and our seas are full of raw human sewage.",
