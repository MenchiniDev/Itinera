As soon as it gets warmer hit \"Park Jordana\" skatepark it is always filled with people skating.\n\nThere are also 2 places you can skate during Winter one is a pool - look up pool forum and another one is streetpark. The later had dedicated skateboarding session you can come to.\n\nYou can always hit up local skaters on ig as well just use hash tags for krakow and skateboarding.",
