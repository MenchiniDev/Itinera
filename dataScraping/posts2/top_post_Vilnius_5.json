And this was 2 years ago. 2 months ago they closed auxiliary road for repairs, traffic went up by 50%.\n\nThis notion that adding lanes \"doesnt reduce traffic\" only works if there is another bottleneck in the system OR there is infinite amount of cars.\n\nI have been to many European cities in western countries of similar size, none of them had this problem with traffic, despite having similar amount of cars. Face it - Vilnius is badly designed, the last Mayor and his staff were absolute tools. And this problem will only get worse as Vilnius will only expand",

Additionalnto removing green pointers.. \nIn 10 years lithuania became ‚Äûcountry of road bumpers and speed radars‚Äú it is like every 100m is one or another and.... Suprise suprise the fatality in the roads increased. It even became worse that Poland, where roads are more complicated, everyone is speeding in their autobans, there is no speed cams/road bumpers, and the traffic is much more intense.\n\nSoviet era made lithuanians mental slaves who think that restrictions and punishments can solve some things. It is an opposit.\n\nIn germany every day tenths of thousanda people moving in their at 200+kmh daily and have 3x lower road fatality rate than in lithuania with bumper/speed  cam/cop in bushes every 100m.\nBecause we are idiots and brain damaged soviets.",
