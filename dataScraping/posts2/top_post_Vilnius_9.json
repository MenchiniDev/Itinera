You could try advertising your services on Facebook groups oriented towards foreigners. Maybe you could offer pet sitting or dog walking services. Hotels and bars always need staff so it might actually just be worth going into a few and asking if thereâ€™s anything available.\n\nI donâ€™t know what your native language is but offering to teach that might be useful.",
