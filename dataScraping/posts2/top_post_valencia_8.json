If you suspect they have eaten some meds/poison/ batteries/ plants you should seek professional help quite fast because the faster they make them vomit the better the outcome it is and less damage to the organs. If you suspect she has eaten some material an eco/ some radiographs would be helpful before proceeding to any procedure. If is early stage you could use an endoscope to remove and is less invasive than surgical removal.",

            "body": "It is not ethical to go over another‚Äôs vet job and advise as a vet. Since you are worried and concerned about your cat, being in a foreign country I can understand you. Your vet is not wrong. Now depends how big it is the elastic rope. Here are 3 different things might happen: one, just chewed and lost it in the house, second eaten and it will just poop it 24 h or more( is critical to search for any piece in the stools) and the worst scenario is to get blocked into intestines but that happens in time. In radiography and ecography you could see later signs. Since has no metal piece hard to see anything on xrays And ecography,would be tricky even for a specialist. The best now would be an MRI where you can see small details but the costs involved‚Ä¶ up to you and your buget. I can tell you what to do but waiting 24 h and see how it goes could be or just to go and make her vomit is a chance as well as long as is still in the stomach (somewhere in between 30min -1h) if longer than that less changes to throw it up. If passes 24 h since the event I would be really careful monitoring the food intake and water intake as well as the stools. Do not forget what comes in has to come out (+\\~). If she is starting to act strange not eating/pooping/vomiting/sad/abdomen pain etc go to the vet. Hope it helps you. And if you need any other help let me know.",

So idk how old is your cat or what other health issues she has, body score, how are her bloods as each anesthesia implies a risk  even if they are healthy. And they might not find anything if passed the stomach and fist part of the intestines. Depends how well equipped are they and experience. I would consider first instance vomiting. Is quite easy and least expensive and invasive. Is small bits comes out happy days or even the piece if no‚Ä¶ wait and see. But as I said depends when it happened.",
