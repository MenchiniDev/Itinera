Snowfall on its own is unlikely to cause severe disruptions.",

It's obviously more likely you'll see delays due to weather during winter than summer. But it's not a huge issue. You'll often see articles about mass delays/cancelations due to the weather, but I travel abroad to Spain or Norway to visit family during the winter a lot, and I've never dealt with delays or cancelations due to the weather. \n\nAnd if something like that *does* happen, your airline will cover you.
