Though I don't think half the people here are intelligent enough to consider just why social order is decaying amongst the lower classes in recent years, and how it's only going to get worse as the years go by.\n\nLet's just see what happens with the new generation, being abused on increasingly prevalent agency contracts, money's new way of skirting all the employment laws we've worked so hard for. Factories and warehouses are phasing out permanent staff *en masse*, to pay *double* what they pay for regular staff (half of which goes to the agency) in order to be able to fire us at will. We'll never own a house, most of us won't afford to have kids and if we do, the future isn't looking bright for them.\n\nThis country is gonna experience what every country does when the robbery of the working class is complete and we're reverted to this new form of modern wage slavery. Problems. MMW it's going to get worse and worse as people have less and less hope. The middle class sold us out to protect themselves and now it's their turn. Your displays of how much money you have, say outside your house to bring \"Christmas cheer\", are targets for angry young people. And deservedly so. Keeping your wealth as private as possible will be the way going forward.",
