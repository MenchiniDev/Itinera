Labour has attacked them on it several times on the Russian property investor community funding Tories, both party and individuals, maybe you missed that.

It could well be over 10 years. Elon Musk has a tendency of overpromising and underdelivering, as men with great ambitions often do.\n\nI should say, that I don't particularly like Farage, though I did vote for Reform. They are the only party that made any effort to reach out to SME's which is this country's sole success story at the minute. Starmer's policies any retard could tell you that they were obviously (and currently are) going to butcher them.

It sounds pretty reasonable to avoid the ones you've seen. UKIP was a pressure group that successfully forced the Tories to call a referendum. You may not like that, but it's a fair point. There is a degree of irony in the same way the Nazis attempted to use elections to remove the ability to vote.\n\nHopefully, the Tories, Labour, or any party will come to their senses and appeal to the working man. Until then, I will vote for the closest alternative to my view.",

Phenomenal. Well, at least I'm going into this *knowing* I'm arguing with someone without great critical thinking.\n\n>This biggest trade bloc (which it isn't without the UK) is also grossly stagnant, like ourselves. We shouldn't peg ourselves to a bloc as useless as our own trade. We should have left later, actually. \n\nLeaving the \"grossly stagnant\" trade block has actively hammered our economy on almost every available metric. I'm not sure if you understand this, but our economy would be stagnant at a *richer* level (or even more likely, we'd have had growth than the rest of the Eurozone) had we remained in the EU.\n\nThe stagnation on the continent is as unavoidable as our own. Tearing down workers' rights and allowing the pockets of billionairs to be lined is not a serious solution to the problems Europe has. Greater investment in education, infrastructure and the strengthening of the average household's income *are* serious solutions. Reform is proposing the former, not the latter.\n\n>We should have left later, actually.\n\nDespite what former banker and toad faced liar [Nigel Farage said?](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-brexit-article-50-triggered-response-point-of-no-return-eu-a7656436.html)\n\n>Well, going with your example, if you're looking for someone hung like a horse, and you've slept with two of the four contenders. It sounds pretty reasonable to avoid the ones you've seen. \n\nExcept Labour never pretended, and still aren't pretending, there are easy routes out of our current situation - unlike Reform. You are simply not thinking this through enough to resist someone falsely selling you a way out of a difficult situation. You would rather gamble on a quick fix, which is almost certainly not going to happen, than take the mild discomfort of following the actual way. \n\nYou act like experimenting with Reform would be harmleas, while ignoring the fact they follow the economic philosophy of Truss and Kwarteng. Voting Reform in the hope they will solve the woes of a situation their leader helped create is like emailing back the Nigerian prince in your spam folder. You will get no solution. You will just be left scammed and poorer.\n\n>Until then, I will vote for the closest alternative to my view.\n\nGiven the sheer incoherence and naivety behind all the points you have made, you may end up actually voting for party that will deliver something very much opposed to your view.",

It's a global one and the UK contributes 1.7% to carbon emissions, meanwhile China, USA, Russia and India produce more than the rest of the world. The UK could be void of human and animals alike, it wouldn't touch the sides. The only benefit to Net Zero is energy independence, which should have been achieved years ago with nuclear, which Labour, Lib Dems and the Greens were all against.\n\nIf Farage gained power, I'd vote for someone else.",

The scientists told us the vaccines prevented you getting Covid, that was a lie. You couldn't transmit Covid. Another lie. The death figures released were lies. The efficacy of initial vaccines, you could do the maths yourself and were never close to 90%. They were more in-line with 65%. Anyone still believing Covid was going to achieve the bubonic plague levels of chaos are retards.\n\nWe started the process to leave, argued for two years about what leaving looks like and then had no time to implement any policy. There was always going to be an economic rebalance, but by pre-Covid the economy was boringly stable. Covid somehow didn't happen in the eyes of Remainers, and they still think Brexit had a bigger effect, somehow because... retards. Fast forward to Liz Fuck up and the Tories are just laughing at us. Sunak  (and Hunt who I hate to admit) was actually decent on the economy, despite being politically useless. Now we have the lefties in charge and in no surprise to anyone, Rachel Reeves is tanking the country because she's not a Bank of England economist like she was trying to make out...\n\nI don't think experimenting with Reform is harmless at all. I think the best possible action our country can take is to give no party too much power and even out the political landscape. Tories had a huge majority and fucked up, Labour have a huge majority and are currently fucking us. I hope that in the next election, we see a 30% vote share between the three. Then you'll find the policies that do make it through actually have a reasonable and pragmatic consensus across parliament.",
