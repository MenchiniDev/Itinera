I would just really carefully check your other belongings to do the best you can to avoid them having to open your case (eg I got searched recently because my toothpaste tube was too big 😞).\n\nETA: loads of people travel with engagement rings for planned proposals, I assume they just stick them in their bag and call it good??",
