Also, trains usually run relatively late and you're less likely to get stuck at night (looking at you, Munich!).\n\nHonestly, I would just take public transport because I wouldn't wanna deal with potential car sharing issues and differences between traffic customs in Germany vs Denmark, but admittedly that with 4 people that might be overall more expensive because public transport does not offer any group tickets.",

If you're a student and working part time most people would consider that a student job.\n\n>What salary should I expect/aim for?\n\nProbably around 120-130 kr/hour for non-skilled work (restaurants, bars etc) or 160-170 for office jobs relevant to your degree. It likely won't be enough to cover tuition and living costs.\n\n>How difficult is it to find work in the field of studies? Does it matter to the employer that I am not from the EU?\n\nPretty easy for a typical Danish CBS student but in my experience Eastern European students are more likely to end up doing service jobs or Wolt deliveries. As long as you're allowed to work I doubt your EU status will matter.\n\n>Which channel would you recommend for finding a job? - Linkedin/JobTeaser and such; sending emails to recruiters; going in person with a CV in my hand; or going to job fairs??? Or something else?\n\nLinkedIn, CBS job fairs, CBS online job board, JobIndex etc for professional jobs. I don't really know about service work – probably Instagram and talking to people.\n\n>What is the general opinion on the school? Is it worth it to go there? (CBS)\n\nIt's pretty well regarded but some degrees seem a bit easy, especially when people can work almost full-time and complete their degrees at the same time.\n\n>If there is any, what opinion do Danes hold for Balkan people? Be honest, I've travelled a lot, I am used to it.\n\nI don't think people have strong opinions about Balkan people. We took a lot of refugees in the 90s and they seem to have turned out fine.\n\nMost Eastern European students I've met in Copenhagen have been studying at non-university programs like \"business academies\", working service jobs and smoking lots of weed.

            "body": "> Thanks will look for guides as well. Not the best time as in meaning the weather will be bad?\n\nI mean also that, but my main point is that the whole vibe is different. From the kind of dolce vita enjoying the life in summer, by sitting outside by the harbor and swimming to a place which is only goes from light grey to dark and feels like the zombie apocalypse happened and the city is dead (because everyone is either at home or on vacation in the south).\n\nWhat place I recommend? Uhm, my [Google Maps looks like this](https://imgur.com/a/S4fDYMd), so basically just about anything in Indre By, Vesterbro or Nørrebro is worth checking out. Incidentally that's exactly what I would recommend. The city is quite walkable and overall also quite pretty so walking around at random and exploring is actually a great way to experience Copenhagen.\n\nIt depends what you're interested in. I could tell you my favorite places but if you're not a total hipster they might or might not be of any interest to you.",

So, please feel free to suggest anything you think I shouldn’t miss in Copenhagen! :)\n\nMy plan is to wake up early, attend necessary work meetings around 9:30, and then spend the day walking and exploring as much as I can until 20:00-21:00, after which I’ll head back to the hotel to work until bedtime. If I end up too tired to work, I’ll take some time off and spent the whole trip to explore. \n\nI’d love to visit pubs to drink and try some local beer, some street food, burgers, pizzas, breakfast spots and cafes to get a nice coffee while working a bit or relax. Majority of the day will be spent to visit museums, palaces etc.",

I also like Itzi Pitzi and Pico Pizza. There's a number of semi-fancy pizza chains but their pizzas are well, passable.\n\nBurgers I'd say POPL. Lot's of people hype Gasoline but I never got the hype (however they are also on the airport if you have some time after security).\n\nThere's also a ton of cafés. Andersen & Meillard is nice, though I am a bit sad that they don't have pour-over; Coffee Collective is excellent, Darcy's is a local favorite of mine.",

For 24h that would be about 5 museums (card is 500 DKK and museums are slightly north of 100 DKK). I don't think I could do that but I also don't like rushing through museums so YMMV.",
