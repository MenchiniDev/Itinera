Nobody has ever asked to see the little booklet from AAA-- not when renting a car, not when stopped by police, nor when passing through borders.\r\n\r\nWith that said, as others have mentioned, car rental companies usually have restrictions on leaving the EU. If you carefully check policies, you can find rental companies that will do it (I don't remember which of the English speaking / tourist friendly ones do it, but I know some do), but it's always accompanied by a hefty price increase. Also, while I don't find driving in Hungary to be particularly challenging, Serbian drivers can be aggressive, and Belgrade (at least the parts you'll want to see) can be very difficult to drive in.\r\n\r\nAir Serbia has twice daily flights between Budapest-- usually for less than $100. It's more expensive than a bus, but the ride on the M5 to Belgrade is pretty boring, and you won't spend hours waiting at the Hungary-Serbia border crossing.",
