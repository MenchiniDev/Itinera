Tickets are released every 20 minutes according to time slot- at the :50, :10, and :30 minute mark starting at 8:50 am Rome time. I recommend watching the clock app on your phone and refreshing the page exactly at the :59th second. \n\n\nAfter two days of trying to secure these tickets, it’s now 4am and I am slightly delirious and in disbelief.

Guess I got a month left to grind on Duolingo.\n\nI’d like to add that refreshing the page was indeed NOT my friend. Few attempts (5 ish mins?) of doing so ended up getting me kicked out of the website with a tiny “Forbidden” message in the upper left hand corner. Luckily disconnecting from WiFi, and connecting through mobile data hotspot allowed me to get back in and continue trying.\n\nA pro tip that I found on Reddit when panicking after getting forbidden was to click back and forth through months on the calendar, as it updates every 1-2 mins. That helped me stay on the page and still update it without having to refresh the whole page and make the website think I’m a bot. Annoying but atleast it worked!\n\nGoodluck to everyone else fighting against the website to get their tickets!",

Several times, I was able to get 3 tickets in my cart - 2 shy of what I needed. I tried every subsequent time slot and refreshed between times to see if any tickets were released from carts by customers who didn't get what they were looking for.\n\nIn the end, I got 5 tickets for the 24H ONLY ARENA (but can't actually see how they are any different from the 24h – COLOSSEUM, ROMAN FORUM, PALATINE tickets which are more plentiful, but the same price).\n\nOne thing I noticed on the tickets sent by email is that we are to use is the Stern Entrance which may or may not have a shorter wait time.

It’s so clearly  honest mistake beacuse why would anyone buy two tickets for themself on the same day with 15 minutes difference in beetwen and sister and I have last name. I asked guy in some yellow shirt at the first entry point and he told me that he can let her in, but rest of security check or whatsoever not gonna let her go and that we need to wait in line tommorow to buy new ticket. I’m so nervous right now and mad to be honest beacuse it’s such a clear situation and I see no reason for slight tolerance in our case. Whats your opionion, is there still a posibility that they will let us both in? Is there some info or complaint desk or something similar or some staff with higher authority then those guys at the entry point that I can go to to explain myself and potentionally get permsion for sister to go in?

I was learning a little Italian. It was a complete waste and also in the underground guided tour there is nothing much to see really; just a few passageways and the lifts that are reconstructed to lift the animals up. The official guide stopped the tour when we reached the arena. Whereas I noticed for the third party tours their guide took them through all the exhibits. It is actually better to use the official free audio guide and buy regular tickets but for some reason I was unable to download it on my phone.",

Some say just to wait it out but still I don’t want to risk not getting any waiting for the last minute for the tickets to be released so instead, (this is what I did:)\n\nI bought the most “basic” one. (18€) The Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill tickets instead. Based on my research, You can access the floors which I think is already suitable for us. Paying extra for the Arena didn’t seem quite worth it for ME (plus the risk of waiting a week before ticket release) the more I research about the difference between the two. \n\nI guess the Full Experience will benefit you if you need the 48 hours and of course the Arena itself. The Arena will be the platform you see in the recent colosseum photos. Which you can have an almost 360 view unlike when you’re in just the floors itself. Also the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill is I believe huge in size and it might take more hours to explore thats where you’ll need the 48 hours if you have time. \n\nPs. I haven’t been yet. Will be travelling on September. Just sharing my own thoughts on the matter. :)\n\nI hope I did help in some way(?) or someone else who needs a little info. 🙂 Have a safe travel!",

However, the guided underground tour is only 45 minutes and the Arena platform is only the size of 3 basketball courts. You don't really need an hour to take all angles on the Arena platform. So if your entry time is far apart, there is nothing much to do at the common passageway.\n\nFrom what I experienced, as long as you don't take the stairs up to the second floor of the Colosseum open to all ticket holders (except Arena only ticket holders), you can still make your way back to the common passageway. But once you take the stairs up to the second floor, you can only follow the one-way route to the final exit (which does not bring you back to the common passageway).",

Where did you purchase the tickets? 2) The 3rd party tours I’ve seen are $160-180 a person so I’m wondering if it’s worth it.  From your experience it sounds like it’s not but I read you saw other groups taking other routes. Did it seem like it was worth it for them ?",
