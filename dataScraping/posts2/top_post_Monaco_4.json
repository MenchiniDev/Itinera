How does that make sense?\n\nNot to mention the repetition of it all.  I can't even eat chicken on my diet 3 days in a row.  Why am I going to put 50% of my wealth on something that I will get tired of in a few days, or at the most, weeks?\n\nWhat are these girls thinking?  Are they thinking?\n\nI've been confused by this my entire life, and if I ask the girls to explain themselves, they start calling me horrible names :)",
