The offender was a young lad who's car was packed to the brim, casually eating sweets as he told me this stuff happened to him all of the time.\n\nAfter the initial assessment and waiting for the car to be towed an officer approached me and said he could smell weed and that I had to do a drugs test for it. I was in shock at the time and complied, despite clearly not smelling of weed or showing any signs of being innebreiated. \n\nHe held me in the police car for 45 minutes waiting for the test to come up positive. Just kept turning back to look at me then the test. When it was pretty obvious that I was sober he was clearly disappointed and frustrated, then told me that I was lucky it was clear \"You would have been locked up\". \n\nLike, fuck off mate? I'm sober and just had my car written off? Lost any remaining respect for the police about then",

Bail out with extendables fully erect and ready go, and are eyeballing me like like the last turkey at christmas. Drag me out, acting like Im driving the parked, broken, not on engine and ready to boot it away. \n\nSo, I explain the details. I further explain that they should already know this, since they responded the night before and took a detailed report. Had caught in the cunts in the act, and was really a big deal only 8 hours earlier. So there I am, standing outside my house and the prick says \"Where do you live?\". So I point and say \"there.\". Prick gets right in my grill and starts calling me all the cheeky little cunts under the sun. A bit of back and worth, because I wont fucking stand being spoken to like that, and he finally asks the question that he meant to in the first place. \"What is your address?\".\n\nAt no point in the interaction was there any attempts on their part to de-escalate. It was ramped up at every turn in an effort to make me cower to them. And that was my crime too. That I dared to look at them when they jumped out their car brandishing weapons, in plain clothes, in broad daylight. Apparently I should have been too scared to look or something. \n\nLost all respect for cops right then and its never come back. Ill be civil, but thats it.

These issues were more likely to occur in communities of colour where the police were not as diverse as the community they represented exacerbating cultural misunderstandings. The original idea, as I understand it, was that if the money spent on the police dealing with those issues was just given to the community in the first place, then there would be less issues and less people hurt.

The easy answer is that people don't *have* to work these jobs, but it's also pretty easy to get instutitionalised into a career, or not everyone has the luxury of being able to move laterally or just quit when they need an income to survive.\n\nI imagine it's the same in the police force, or any other institution.",

Of course there are issues, and the one you mention I imagine is a big one. \n\nHowever, I think it’s dangerous to suggest all police officers, or any group, should be tarred with the same brush. There are good and bad police officers, like there are good and bad doctors, or any other group. The good ones still have families who fear for their lives on a regular basis. This rhetoric we are slipping into of ‘all police officers are terrible’ is not helpful. If I were a good police officer (I’m not one at all, FYI), it must be really demoralising to be on the receiving end of this constantly when you know you’re doing a good job. I can’t for the life of me fathom why anyone would want to do it as a career, and given one of the other major issues they face is lack of resources, this rhetoric isn’t exactly going to encourage people who can help to make a difference to join.",
